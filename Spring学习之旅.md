>> This part of the reference documentation covers all the technologies that are absolutely integral to the Spring Framework.

>> Formost amongst these is the Spring Framework's Inversion of Control (IoC) container. A thorough treatment of the Spring Framework's IoC container is closely followed by comprehensive coverage of Spring's Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) technologies. The Spring Framework has its own AOP framework, which is conceptually easy to understand and which successfully addresses the 80% sweet spot of AOP requirements in Java enterprise programming.

>> Coverage of Spring's integration with AspectJ (currently the richest - in terms of features - and certainly most mature AOP implementation in the Java enterprise space) is also provided.
# 1. The IoC Container
## 1.1 Introducation to the Spring IoC Container and Beans

IoC is known as dependency injection (DI). It is a process whereby objects define their dependencies (that is, the other objects they work with) only through constructor arguments, arguments to a factory method, or properties that are set on the object instance after it is constructed or returned from a factory method. The container then injects those dependencies when it creates the bean. This process is fundamentally the inverse (hense the name, Inversion of Control) of the bean itself controlling the instantiation or location of its dependencies by using direct construction of classes or a mechanism such as the Service Locator pattern.

The `org.springframework.beans` and `org.springframework.context` packages are the basis for Spring Framework's IoC container. The `BeanFactory` interface provides an advanced configuration mechanism capable of managing any type of object. `ApplicationContext` is a sub-interface of `BeanFactory`. It adds:

(1) Easier integration with Spring's AOP features.

(2) Message resource handling (for use in internationalization).

(3) Event publication.

(4) Application-layer specific contexts such as the `WebApplicationContext` for use in web applications.

In the short, the `BeanFactory` provides the configuration framework and basic functionality, and the `ApplicationContext` adds more enterprise-specific functionality. The `ApplicationContext` is a complete superset of the `BeanFactory`.

In Spring, the objects that form the backbone of your application and that are managed by the Spring IoC container are called beans. A bean is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and otherwise managed by a Spring IoC container. Otherwise, a bean is simply one of many objects in your application. Beans, and the dependencies among them, are reflected in the configuration metadata used by a container.
## 1.2 Container Overview

The `org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext` interface represents the Spring IoC container and is responsible for instantiating, configuring, and assembling the beans. The container gets its instructions on what objects to instantiate, configure, and assemble by reading configuration metadata. The configuration metadata is represented in XML, Java annotations, or Java code. It lets you express the objects that compose your application and the rich interdependencies between those objects.

Several implementations of the `ApplicationContext` interface are supplied with Spring. In stand-alone applications, it is common to create an instance of `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext` or `FileSystemXmlApplicationContext`. While XML has been the traditional format for defining configuration metadata, you can instruct the container to use Java annotations or code as the metadata format by providing a small amount of XML configuration to declaratively enable support for these additional metatdata formats.


In most application scenarios, explicit user code is not required to instantiate one or more instances of a Spring IoC container. For example, in a web application scenario, a simple eight (or so) lines of boilerplate web descriptor XML in the `web.xml` file of the application typically suffices. If you use the `Spring Tools for Eclipse` (an Eclipse-powered development environment), you can easily create this boilerplate configuration with a few mouse clicks or keystrokes.

The following diagram shows a high-level view of how Spring works. Your application classes are combined with configuration metadata so that, after the `ApplicationContext` is created and initialized, you have a fully configured and executable system or application.

### 1.2.1 Configuration Metadata

As the preceding diagram shows, the Spring IoC container consumes a form of configuration metadata. This configuration metadata represents how you, as an application developer, tell the Spring container to instantiate, configure, and assemble the objects in your application.

Configuration metatdata is traditionally supplied in a simple and intuitive XML format, which is what most of this chapter uses to convey key concepts and features of the Spring IoC container.

> XML based metadata is not the only allowed form of configuration metadata. The Spring IoC container itself is totally decoupled from the format in which this configuration metadata is actually written. These days, many developers choose Java-based configuration for their Spring applications.

For information about using other forms of metadata with the Spring container, see:

(1) Annotation-based configuration: Spring 2.5 introduced support for annotation-based configuration metadata.

(2) Java-based configuration: Starting with Spring 3.0, many features provided by the Spring JavaConfig project became part of the core Spring Framework. Thus, you can define beans external to your application classed by using Java rather than XML files. To use these new features, see the `@Configuration`, `@Bean`,`@Inport` and `@DependsOn` annotations.

Spring configuration consists of at least one and typically more than one bean definition that the container must manage. XML-based configuration metadata configures these beans as `<bean/>` elements inside a top-level `<beans/>` element. Java configuration typically uses `@Bean`-annotated methods within a `@Configuration` class.

These bean definitions correspond to the actual objects that make up your application. Typically, you define service layer objects, data access objects (DAOs), presentation objects such as Stuts `Action` instances, infrastructure objects such as Hibernate `SessionFactories`, JMS `Queues`, and so forth. Typically, one does not configure fine-grained domain objects in the container, because it is usually the responsibility of DAOs and business logic to create and load domain objects. However, you can use Spring's integration with AspectJ to configure objects that have been created outside the control of an IoC container.

The following example shows the basic structure of XML-based configuration metadata:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
        https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

        <!-- The id attribute is a string that identifies the individual bean definition. -->
        <!-- The class attribute defines the type of the bean and uses the fully qualified classname. -->
    <bean id="..." class="...">  
        <!-- collaborators and configuration for this bean go here -->
    </bean>

    <bean id="..." class="...">
        <!-- collaborators and configuration for this bean go here -->
    </bean>

    <!-- more bean definitions go here -->

</beans>
```

The value of the `id` attribute refers to collaborating objects.
### 1.2.2 Instantiating a Container

The location path or paths supplied to an `ApplicationContext` constructor are resource strings that let the container load configuration metadata from a variety of external resources, such as the local file system, the Java `CLASSPATH`, and so on.

```java
ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("services.xml", "daos.xml");
```

>> After you learn about Spring's IoC container, you may want to know more about Spring's `Resource` abstraction, which provides a convenient mechanism for reading an InputStream from locations defined in a URI syntax. In particular, `Resource` paths are used to construct applications contexts.

The following example shows the service layer objects `(services.xml)` configuration file:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
        https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

    <!-- services -->

    <bean id="petStore" class="org.springframework.samples.jpetstore.services.PetStoreServiceImpl">
        <property name="accountDao" ref="accountDao"/>
        <property name="itemDao" ref="itemDao"/>
        <!-- additional collaborators and configuration for this bean go here -->
    </bean>

    <!-- more bean definitions for services go here -->

</beans>
```

The following example shows the data access objects `daos.xml` file:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
        https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

    <bean id="accountDao"
        class="org.springframework.samples.jpetstore.dao.jpa.JpaAccountDao">
        <!-- additional collaborators and configuration for this bean go here -->
    </bean>

    <bean id="itemDao" class="org.springframework.samples.jpetstore.dao.jpa.JpaItemDao">
        <!-- additional collaborators and configuration for this bean go here -->
    </bean>

    <!-- more bean definitions for data access objects go here -->

</beans>
```

In the preceding example, the service layer consists of the `PetStoreServiceImpl` class and two data access objects of the types `JpaAccountDao` and `JpaItemDao` (based on the JPA Object-Relational Mapping standard). The `property name` element refers to the name of the JavaBean property, and the `ref` element refers to the name of another bean definition. This linkage between `id` and `ref` elements expresses the dependency between collaborating objects.

#### Composing XML-based Configuration Metadata

It can be useful to have bean definitions span multiple XML files. Often, each individual XML configuration file represents a logical layer or module in your architecture.

You can use the application context constructor to load bean definitions from all these XML fragments. This constructor takes multiple `Resource` locations, as was shown in the previous section. Alternatively, use one or more occurrences of the `<import/>` element to load bean definitions from another file or files. The following example shows how to do so:

```xml
<beans>
    <import resource="services.xml"/>
    <import resource="resources/messageSource.xml"/>
    <import resource="/resources/themeSource.xml"/>

    <bean id="bean1" class="..."/>
    <bean id="bean2" class="..."/>
</beans>
```

In the preceding example, external bean definitions are loaded from three files: `services.xml`, `messageSource.xml` and `themeSource.xml`. All location paths are relative to the definition file doing the importing, so `services.xml` must in the same directory or classpath location as the file doing the importing, while `messageSource.xml` and `themeSource.xml` must be in a `resources` location below the location of the importing file. As you can see, a leading slash is ignored. However, given that these paths are relative, it is better form not to use the slash at all. The contents of the files being imported, including the top level `<beans/>` element, must be valid XML bean definitions, according to the Spring Schema.

It is possible, but not recommended, to reference files in parent directories using a relative "../" path. Doing so creates a dependency on a file that is outside the current application. In particular, this reference is not recommended for `classpath:` URLs (for example, `classpath:../services.xml`), where the runtime resolution process chooses the "nearest" classpath root and then looks into its parent directory. Classpath configuration changes may lead to the choice of a different, incorrect directory.

You can always use fully qualified resource locations instead of relative paths: for example, `file:C:/config/services.xml` or `classpath:/config/services.xml`. However, be aware that you are coupling your application's configuration to specific absolute locations. It is generally preferable to keep an indirection for such absolute locations - for example, through "${}" placeholders that are resolved against JVM system properties at runtime.

The namespace itself provides import directive feature. Further configuration features beyond plain bean definitions are available in a selection of XML namespaces provided by Spring - for example, the `context` and `util` namespaces.

#### The Groovy Bean Definition DSL Groovy Bean

As a further example for externalized configuration metadata, bean definitions can also be expressed in Spring's Groovy Bean Definition DSL, as known from the Grails framework. Typically, such configuration live in a ".groovy" file with the structure shown in the following example:

```
beans {
    dataSource(BasicDataSource) {
        driverClassName = "org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver"
        url = "jdbc:hsqldb:mem:grailsDB"
        username = "sa"
        password = ""
        settings = [mynew:"setting"]
    }
    sessionFactory(SessionFactory) {
        dataSource = dataSource
    }
    myService(MyService) {
        nestedBean = { AnotherBean bean ->
            dataSource = dataSource
        }
    }
}
```

This configuration style is largely equivalent to XML bean definitions and even supports Spring's XML configuration namespaces. It also allows for importing XML bean definition files through an `importBeans` directive.
### 1.2.3 Using the Container

The `ApplicationContext` is the interface for an advanced factory capable of maintaining a registry of different beans and their dependencies. By using the method `T getBean(String name, Class<T> requiredType)`, you can retrieve instances of your beans.

The `ApplicationContext` lets you read bean definitions and access them, as the following example shows:

```java
ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("services.xml", "daos.xml");  // create and configure beans
PetStoreService service = context.getBean("petStore", PetStoreService.class); //retrieve configured instance
List<String> userList = service.getUsernameList();  // use configured instance
```

With Groovy configuration, bootstrapping looks very similar. It has a different context implementation class which is Groovy-aware (but also understands XML bean definitions). The following example shows Groovy configuration:

```java
ApplicationContext context = new GenericGroovyApplicationContext("services.groovy", "daos.groovy");
```

The most flexible variant is `GenericApplication` in combination with reader delegates - for example, with `XmlBeanDefinitionReader` for XML files, as the following example shows:

```java
GenericApplicationContext context = new GenericApplicationContext();
new XmlBeanDefinitionReader(context).loadBeanDefinitions("services.xml", "daos.xml");
context.refresh();
```

You can also use the `GroovyBeanDefinitionReader` for Groovy files, as the following example shows:

```java
GenericApplicationContext context = new GenericApplicationContext();
new GroovyBeanDefinitionReader(context).loadBeanDefinitions("services.groovy", "daos.groovy");
context.refresh();
```

You can mix and match such reader delegates on the same `ApplicationContext`, reading bean definitions from diverse configuration sources.

You can then use `getBean` to retrieve instances of your beans. The `ApplicationContext` interface has a few other methods for retrieving beans, but, ideally, your application code should never use them. Indeed, your application code should have no calls to the `getBean()` method at all and thus have no dependency on Spring APIs at all. For example, Spring's integration with web frameworks provides dependency injection for various web framework components such as controllers and JSF-managed beans, letting you declare a dependency on a specific bean through metadata (such as an autowring annotation).
## 1.3 Bean Overview

A Spring IoC container manages one or more beans. These beans are created with the configuration that you supply to the container (for example, in the form of XML `<bean/>` definitions).

Within the container itself, these bean definitions are represented as `BeanDefinition` objects, which contain (among other information) the following metadata:

(1) A package-qualified class name: typically, the actual implementation class of the bean being defined.

(2) Bean behavioral configuration elements, which state how the bean should behave in the container (scope, lifecycle callbacks, and so forth).

(3) References to other beans that are needed for the bean to do its work. These references are also called collaborators or dependencies.

(4) Other configuration settings to set in the newly created object - for example, the size limit of the pool or the number of connections to use in a bean that manages a connection pool.

This metadata translates to a set of properties that make up each bean definition. The following table describes these properties:

| Property | Explained in ... |
|:-:|:-:|
| Class | Instantiating Beans |
| Name | Naming Beans |
| Scope | Bean Scopes |
| Constructor arguments | Dependency Injection |
| Properties | Dependency Injection |
| Autowiring mode | Autowiring Collaborators |
| Lazy initialization mode | Lazy-initialized Beans |
| Initialization method | Initialization Callbacks |
| Destruction method | Destruction Callbacks |

In addition to bean definitions that contain information on how to create a specific bean, the `ApplicationContext` implementations also permit the registration of existing objects that are created outside the container (by users). This is done by accesing the ApplicationContext's BeanFactory through the `getBeanFactory()` method, which returns the BeanFactory `DefaultListableBeanFactory` implementation. `DefaultListableBeanFactory` supports this registration through the `registerSingleton(...)` and `registerBeanDefinition(...)` methods. However, typical application work solely with beans defined through regular bean definition metadata.

>> Bean metadata and manually supplied instances need to be registered as early as possible, in order for the container to properly reason about them during autowiring and other introspection steps. While overriding existing metadata and existing singleton instances is supported to some degree, the registration of new beans at runtime (concurrently with live access to the factory) is not officially supported and may lead to concurrent access exceptions, inconsistent state in the bean container, or both.
### 1.3.1 Naming Beans

Every bean has one or more identifiers. These identifiers must be unique within the container that hosts the bean. A bean usually has only one identifier. However, if it requires more than one, the extra ones can be considered aliases.

In XML-based configuration metadata, you use the `id` attribute, the `name` attribute, or both to specify the bean identifiers. The `id` attribute lets you specify exactly one id. Conventionally, these names are alphaumeric ('myBean', 'someService', etc.), but they can contain special characters as well. If you want to introduce other aliases for the bean, you can also specify them in the `name` attribute, separated by a comma (`,`), semicolon (`;`) or white space. As a historical note, in versions prior to Spring 3.1, the `id` attribute was defined as an `xsd:ID` type, which constrained possible characters. As of 3.1, it is defined as an `xsd:string` type. Note that bean `id` uniqueness is still enforced by the container, though no longer by XML parsers.

You are not required to supply a `name` or an `id` for a bean. If you do not supply a `name` or `id` explicitly, the container generates a unique name for that bean. However, if you want to refer to that bean by name, through the use of the `ref` element or a Service Locator style lookup, you must provide a name. Motivations for not supplying a name are related to using inner beans and autowiring collaborators.

> Bean Naming Conventions

>> The convention is to use the standard Java convention for instance field names when naming beans. That is, bean names start with a lowercase letter and are camel-cased from there. Examples of such names include `accountManager`, `accountService`, `userDao`, `loginController`, and so forth.

>> Naming beans consistently makes your configuration easier to read and understand. Also, if you use Spring AOP, it helps a lot when applying advice to a set of beans related by name.

>> With component scanning in the classpath, Spring generates bean names for unnamed components, following the rules described earlier: essentially, taking the simple class name and turning its initial character to lower-case. However, in the (unusual) special case when there is more than one character and both the first and second characters are upper case, the original casing gets preserved. There are the same rules as defined by `java.beans.Introspector.decapitalize` (which Spring uses here).
#### Aliasing a Bean outside the Bean Definition

In a bean definition itself, you can supply more than one name for the bean, by using a combination of up to one name specified by the `id` attribute and any number of other names in the `name` attribute. These names can be equivalent aliases to the same bean and are useful for some situations, such as letting each component in an application refer to a common dependency by using a bean name that is specific to that component itself.

Specifying all aliases where the bean is actually defined is not always adequate, however. It is sometimes desirable to introduce an alias for a bean that is defined elsewhere. This is commonly the case in large systems where configuration is split amongst each subsystem, with each subsystem having its own set of object definitions. In XML-based configuration metadata, you can use the `<alias/>` element to accomplish this. The following example shows how to do so:

```xml
<alias name="fromName" alias="toName"/>
```

In this case, a bean (in the same container) named `fromName` may also, after the use of this alias definition, be referred to as `toName`.

For example, the configuration metadata for subsystem A may refer to a DataSource by the name of `subsystemA-dataSource`. The configuration metadata for subsystem B may refer to a DataSource by the name of `subsystemB-dataSource`. When composing the main application that uses both these subsystems, the main application refers to the DataSource by the name of `myApp-dataSource`. To have all three names refer to the same object, you can add the following alias definitions to the configuration metadata:

```xml
<alias name="myApp-dataSource" alias="subsystemA-dataSource"/>
<alias name="myApp-dataSource" alias="subsystemB-dataSource"/>
```

Now each component and the main application can refer to the dataSource through a name that is unique and guaranteed not to clash with any other definition (effectively creating a namespace), yet they refer to the same bean.

>> If you use Java configuration, the `@Bean` annotation can be used to provide alises.
### 1.3.2 Instantiating Beans

A bean definition is essentially a recipe for creating one or more objects. The container looks at the recipe for a named bean when asked and uses the configuration metadata encapsulated by that bean definition to create (or acquire) an actual object.

If you use XML-based configuration metadata, you specify the type (or class) of object that is to be instantiated in the `class` attribute of the `<bean/>` element. This `class` attribute (which, internally, is a `Class` property on a `BeanDefinition` instance) is usually mandatory. You can use the `Class` property in one of two ways:

(1) Typically, to specify the bean class to be constructed in the case where the container itself directly creates the bean by calling its constructor reflectively, somewhat equivalent to Java code with new `new` operator.

(2) To specify the actual class containing the `static` factory method that is invoked to create the object, int the less common case where the container invokes a `static` factory method on a class to create the bean. The object type returned from the invocation of the `static` factory method may be the same class or another class entirely.

> Inner class names

>> If you want to configure a bean definition for a `static` nested class, you have to use the binary name of the nested class.

>> For example, if you have a class called `SomeThing` in the `com.example` package, and this `SomeThing` has a `static` nested class called `OtherThing`, the value of the `class` attribute on a bean definition would be `com.example.SomeThing$OtherThing`.

>> Notice the use of the `$` character in the name to separate the nested class name from the outer class name.
#### Instantiation with a Constructor

When you create a bean by the constructor approach, all normal classed are usable by and compatible with Spring. That is, the class being developed does not need to implement any specific interfaces or to be coded in a specific fashion. Simply specifying the bean class should suffice. However, depending on what type of IoC you use for that specific bean, you may need a default (empty) constructor.

The Spring IoC container can manage virtually any class you want it to manage. It is not limited to managing true JavaBeans. Most Spring users prefer actual JavaBeans with only a default (no-argument) constructor and appropriate setters and getters modeled after the properties in the container. You can also have more exotic non-bean-style classes in your container. If, for example, you need to use a legacy connection pool that absolutely does not adhere to the JavaBean specification, Spring can manage it as well.

With XML-based configuration metadata you can specify your bean class as follows:

```xml
<bean id="exampleBean" class="examples.ExampleBean"/>

<bean name="anotherExample" class="examples.ExampleBeanTwo"/>
```
#### Instantiation with a Static Factory Method

When defining a bean that you create with a static factory method, use the `class` attribute to specify the class that contains the `static` factory method and an attribute named `factory-method` to specify the name of the factory method itself. You should be able to call this method (with optional arguments, as described later) and return a live object, which subsquently is treated as if it had been created through a constructor. One use for such a bean definition is to call `static` factories in legacy code.

The following bean definition specifies that the bean be created by calling a factory method. The definition does not specify the type (class) of the returned object, only the class containing the factory method. In this example, the `createInstance()` method must be a static method. The following example shows how to specify a factory method:

```xml
<bean id="clientService" class="examples.ClientService" factory-method="createInstance"/>
```

The following example shows a class that would work with the preceding bean definition:

```java
public class ClientService {
    private static ClientService clientService = new ClientService();
    private ClientService() {}

    public static ClientService createInstance() {
        return clientService;
    }
}
```
#### Instantiation by Using an Instance Factory Method

Similar to instantiation through a static factory method, instantiation with an instance factory method invokes a non-static method of an existing bean from the container to create a new bean. To use this mechanism, leave the `class` attribute empty and, in the `factory-bean` attribute, specify the name of a bean in the current (or parent or ancestor) container that contains the instance method that is to be invoked to create the object. Set the name of the factory method itself with the `factory-method` attribute. The following example shows how to configure such a bean:

```xml
<bean id="serviceLocator" class="examples.DefaultServiceLocator"/>
<bean id="clientService" factory-bean="serviceLocator" factory-method="createClientServiceInstance"/>
```

The following example shows the corresponding class:

```java
public class DefaultServiceLocator {

    private static ClientService clientService = new ClientServiceImpl();

    public ClientService createClientServiceInstance() {
        return clientService;
    }
}
```

One factory class can also hold more than one factory method, as the following example shows:

```xml
<bean id="serviceLocator" class="examples.DefaultServiceLocator"/>

<bean id="clientService" factory-bean="serviceLocator" factory-method="createClientServiceInstance"/>

<bean id="accountService" factory-bean="serviceLocator" factory-method="createAccountServiceInstance"/>
```

The following example shows the corresponding class:

```java
public class DefaultServiceLocator {

    private static ClientService clientService = new ClientServiceImpl();

    private static AccountService accountService = new AccountServiceImpl();

    public ClientService createClientServiceInstance() {
        return clientService;
    }

    public AccountService createAccountServiceInstance() {
        return accountService;
    }
}
```

>> In Spring documentation, "factory bean" refers to a bean that is configured in the Spring container and that creates obejcts through an factory method. By contrast, `FactoryBean` refers to a Spring-specific `FactoryBean`.
## 1.4 Dependencies

A typical enterprise application does not consist of a single object (or bean in the Spring parlance). Even the simplest application has a few objects that work together to present what the end-user sees as a coherent application. This next section explains how you go from defining a number of bean definitions that stand alone to a fully realized application where objects collaborate to achieve a goal.
### 1.4.1 Dependency Injection

Dependency injection (DI) is a process whereby objects define their dependencies (that is, the other objects with which they work) only through constructor arguments, arguments to a factory method, or properties that are set on the object instance after it is constructed or returned from a factory method. The container then injects those dependencies when it creates the bean. This process is fundamentally the inverse (hence the name, Inversion of Control) of the bean itself controlling the instantiation or location of its dependencies on its own by using direct construction of classes or the Service Locator pattern.

Code is cleaner with the DI principle, and decouping is more effective when objects are provided with their dependencies. The object does not look up its dependencies and does not know the location or class of the dependencies. As a result, your class become easier to test, particular when the dependencies are on interfaces or abstract base classes, which allow for stub or mock implementations to be used in unit tests.

DI exists in two major variants: `Constructor-based dependency injection` and `Setter-based dependency injection`.
#### Constructor-based Dependency Injection

Constructor-based DI is accomplished by the container invoking a constructor with a number of arguments, each representing a dependency. Calling a `static` factory method with specific arguments to construct the bean is nearly equivalent, and this discussion treats arguments to a constructor and to a `static` factory method similarly. The following example shows a class that only be dependency-injected with constructor injection:

```java
public class SimpleMovieLister {

    // the SimpleMovieLister has a dependency on a MovieFinder
    private MovieFinder movieFinder;

    // a constructor so that the Spring container can inject a MovieFinder
    public SimpleMovieLister(MovieFinder movieFinder) {
        this.movieFinder = movieFinder;
    }

    // business logic that actually uses the injected MovieFinder is omitted...
}
```

Notice that there is nothing special about this class. It is a POJO that has no dependencies on container specific interfaces, base classes or annotations.
##### Constructor Argument Resolution

Constructor argument resolution matching occurs by using the argument's type. If no potential ambiguity exists in the consturctor arguments of a bean definition, the order in which the constructor arguments are defined in a bean definition is the order in which those arguments are supplied to the appropriate constructor when the bean is being instantiated. Consider the following class:

```java
public class ThingOne {

    public ThingOne(ThingTwo thingTwo, ThingThree thingThree) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

Assuming that `ThingTwo` and `ThingThree` classes are not related by inheritance, no potential ambiguity exists. Thus, the following configuration works fine, and you do not need to specify the constructor argument indexes or types explicitly in the `<constructor-arg/>` element.

```xml
<beans>
    <bean id="beanOne" class="x.y.ThingOne">
        <constructor-arg ref="beanTwo"/>
        <constructor-arg ref="beanThree"/>
    </bean>

    <bean id="beanTwo" class="x.y.ThingTwo"/>

    <bean id="beanThree" class="x.y.ThingThree"/>
</beans>
```

When another bean is referenced, the type is known, and matching can occur (as was the case with the preceding example). When a simple type is used, such as `<value>true<value/>`, Spring cannot determine the type of the value, and so cannot match by type without help. Consider the following class:

```java
public class ExampleBean {

    // Number of years to calculate the Ultimate Answer
    private int years;

    // The Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything
    private String ultimateAnswer;

    public ExampleBean(int years, String ultimateAnswer) {
        this.years = years;
        this.ultimateAnswer = ultimateAnswer;
    }
}
```
###### Constructor argument type matching

In the preceding scenario, the container can use type matching with simple types if you explicitly specify the type of the constructor argument by using the `type` attribute. As the following example shows:

```xml
<bean id="exampleBean" class="examples.ExampleBean">
    <constructor-arg type="int" value="7500000"/>
    <constructor-arg type="java.lang.String" value="42"/>
</bean>
```
###### Constructor argument index

You can use the `index` attribute to specify explicitly the index of constructor arguments, as the following example shows:

```xml
<bean id="exampleBean" class="examples.ExampleBean">
    <constructor-arg index="0" value="7500000"/>
    <constructor-arg index="1" value="42"/>
</bean>
```

In addition to resolving the ambiguity of multiple simple values, specifying an index resolves ambiguity where a consructor has two arguments of the same type.

>> The index is 0-based.
###### Constructor argument name

You can also use the constructor parameter name for value disambiguation, as the following example shows:

```xml
<bean id="exampleBean" class="examples.ExampleBean">
    <constructor-arg name="years" value="7500000"/>
    <constructor-arg name="ultimateAnswer" value="42"/>
</bean>
```

Keep in mind that, to make this work out of the box, your code must be compiled with the debug flag enabled so that Spring can look up the parameter name from the constructor. If you cannot or do not want to compile your code with the debug flag, you can use the `@ConstructorProperties` JDK annotation to explicitly name your constructor arguments. The sample class would then have to look as follows:

```java
public class ExampleBean {
    @ConstructorProperties({"years", "ultimateAnswer"})
    public ExampleBean(int years, String ultimateAnswer) {
        this.years = years;
        this.ultimateAnswer = ultimateAnswer;
    }
}
```
#### Setter-based Dependency Injection

Setter-based DI is accomplished by the container calling setter methods on your beans after invoking a no-argument constructor or a no-argument static factory method to instantiate your bean.

The following example shows a class that can only be dependency-injected by using pure setter injection. This class is conventional Java. It is a POJO that has no dependencies on container specific interfaces, base classes, or annotations.

```java
public class SimpleMovieLister {
    private MovieFinder movieFinder;

    public void setMovieFinder(MovieFinder movieFinder) {
        this.movieFinder = movieFinder;
    }
}
```

The `ApplicationContext` supports constructor-based and setter-based DI for the beans it manages. It also supports setter-based DI after some dependencies have already been injected through the constructor approach. You configure the dependencies in the form of a `BeanDefinition`, which you use in conjunction with `PropertyEditor` instances to convert properties from one format to another. However, most Spring users do not work with these classes directly (that is, programmatically) but rather with XML bean definitions, annotated components (that is, classes annotated with `@Component`, `@Controller`, and so forth), or `@Bean` methods in Java-based `@Configuration` classes. These sources are then converted internally into instances of `BeanDefinition` and used to load an entire Spring IoC container instance.

> Constructor-based or setter-based DI?

>> Since you can mix constructor-based and setter-based DI, it is a good rule of thumb to use constructors for mandatory dependencies and setter methods or configuration methods for optional dependencies. Not that use of the `@Required` annotation on a setter method can be used to make the property be a required dependency; however, constructor injection with programmatic validation of arguments is preferable.

>> The Spring team generally advocates construtor injection, as it lets you implement application components as immutable objects and ensures that required dependencies are not null. Furthermore, constructor-injected components are always returned to the client (calling) code in a fully initialized state. As a side node, a large number of constructor arguments is a bad code smell, implying that the class likely has too many responsibilities and should be better address proper separation of concerns.

>> Setter injection should primarily only be used for optional dependencies that can be assigned reasonable default values within the class. Otherwise, not-null checks must be performed everywhere the code uses the dependency. One benefit of setter injection is that setter methods make objects of that class amenable to reconfiguration or re-injection later. Management through JMX MBeans is therefore a compelling use case for setter injection.

>> Use the DI style that makes the most sense for a particular class. Sometimes, when dealing with third-party classes for which you do not have the source, the choice is made for you. For example, if a third-party class does not expose any setter methods, then constructor injection may be the only available form of DI.
#### Dependency Resolution Process

The container performs bean dependency resolution as follows:

(1) The `ApplicationContext` is created and initialized with configuration metadata that describes all the beans. Configuration metadata can be specified by XML, Java code, or annotations.

(2) For each bean, its dependencies are expressed in the form of properties, constructor arguments, or arguments to the static-factory method (if you use that instead of a normal constructor). These dependencies are provided to the bean, when the bean is actually created.

(3) Each property or constructor argument is an actual definition of the value to set, or a reference to another bean in the container.

(4) Each property or constructor argument that is value is converted from its specified format to the actual type of that property or constructor argument. By default, Spring can convert a value supplied in string format to all built-in types, such as `int`, `long`, `String`, `boolean`, and so forth.

The Spring container validates the configuration of each bean as the container is created. However, the bean properties themselves are not set until the bean is actually created. Beans that are singleton-scoped and set to be pre-instantiated (the default) are created when the container is created. Scopes are defined in Bean Scopes. Otherwise, the bean is created only when it is requested. Creation of a bean potentially causes a graph of beans to be created, as the bean's dependencies and its denpendencies' dependencies (and so on) are created and assigned. Note that resolution mismatches among those dependencies may show up late - that is, on first creation of the affected bean.

> Circular dependencies

>> If you use predominantly constructor injection, it is possible to create an unresolvable circular dependency scenario.

>> For example: Class A requires an instance of class B through constructor injection, and class B requires an instance of class A through constructor injection. If you configure beans for classes A and B to be injected into each other, the Spring IoC container detects this circular reference at runtime, and throws a `BeanCurrentlyInCreationException`.

>> One possible solution is to edit the source code of some classes to be configured by setters rather than constructors. Alternatively, avoid constructor injection and use setter injection only. In other words, although it is not recommended, you can configure circular dependencies with setter injection.

>> Unlike the typical case (with no circular dependencies), a circular dependency between bean A and bean B forces one of the beans to be injected into the other prior to being fully initialized itself (a classic chicken-and-egg scenario).

You can generally trust Spring to do the right thing. It detects configuration problems, such as references to non-existent beans and circular dependencies, at container load-time. Spring sets properties and resolves dependencies as late as possible, when the bean is actually created. This means that a Spring container that has loaded correctly can later generate an exception when you request an object if there is a problem creating that object or one of its dependencies - for example, the bean throws an exception as a result of a missing or invalid property. This potentially delayed visibility of some configuration issues is why `ApplicationContext` implementations by default pre-instantiate singleton beans. At the cost of some upfront time and memory to create these beans before they are actually needed, you discover configuration issues when the `ApplicationContext` is created, not later. You can still override this default behavior so that singleton beans initialize lazily, rather than being pre-instantiated.

If no circular dependencies exist, when one or more collaborating beans are being injected into a dependent bean, each collaborating bean is totally configured prior to being injected into the dependent bean. This means that, if bean A has a dependency on bean B, the Spring IoC container completely configures bean B prior to invoking the setter method on bean A. In other words, the bean is instantiated (if it is not a pre-instantiated singleton), its dependencies are set, and the relevant lifecycle methods (such as a configred init method or the InitializingBean callback method) are invoked.
#### Examples Dependency Injection

The following example uses XML-based configuration metadata for setter-based DI. A small part of a Spring XML configuration file specifies some bean definitions as follows:

```xml
<bean id="exampleBean" class="examples.ExampleBean">
    <!-- setter injection using the nested ref element -->
    <property name="beanOne">
        <ref bean="anotherExampleBean"/>
    </property>

    <!-- setter injection using the neater ref attribute -->
    <property name="beanTwo" ref="yetAnotherBean"/>
    <property name="integerProperty" value="1"/>
</bean>

<bean id="anotherExampleBean" class="examples.AnotherBean"/>
<bean id="yetAnotherBean" class="examples.YetAnotherBean"/>
```

The following example shows the corresponding `ExampleBean` classes:

```java
public class ExampleBean {
    private AnotherBean beanOne;

    private YetAnotherBean beanTwo;

    private int i;

    public void setBeanOne(AnotherBean beanOne) {
        this.beanOne = beanOne;
    }

    public void setBeanTwo(YetAnotherBean beanTwo) {
        this.beanTwo = beanTwo;
    }

    public void setIntegerProperty(int i) {
        this.i = i;
    }
}
```

In the preceding example, setters are declared to match against the properties specified in the XML file. The following example uses constructor-based DI:

```xml
<bean id="exampleBean" class="examples.ExampleBean">
    <!-- constructor injection using the nested ref element -->
    <constructor-arg>
        <ref bean="anotherExampleBean"/>
    </constructor-arg>

    <!-- constructor injection using the neater ref attribute -->
    <constructor-arg ref="yetAnotherBean"/>

    <constructor-arg type="int" value="1"/>
</bean>

<bean id="anotherExampleBean" class="examples.AnotherBean"/>
<bean id="yetAnotherBean" class="examples.YetAnotherBean"/>
```

The following example shows the corresponding `ExampleBean` class:

```java
public class ExampleBean {
    private AnotherBean beanOne;

    private YetAnotherBean beanTwo;

    private int i;

    public ExampleBean(
        AnotherBean anotherBean, YetAnotherBean yetAnotherBean, int i) {
        this.beanOne = anotherBean;
        this.beanTwo = yetAnotherBean;
        this.i = i;
    }
}
```

The constructor arguments specified in the bean definition are used as arguments to the constructor of the `ExampleBean`.

Now consider a variant of this example, where, instead of using a constructor, Spring is told to call a static factory method to return an instance of the object:

```xml
<bean id="exampleBean" class="examples.ExampleBean" factory-method="createInstance">
    <constructor-arg ref="anotherExampleBean"/>
    <constructor-arg ref="yetAnotherBean"/>
    <constructor-arg value="1"/>
</bean>

<bean id="anotherExampleBean" class="examples.AnotherBean"/>
<bean id="yetAnotherBean" class="examples.YetAnotherBean"/>
```

The following example shows the corresponding `ExampleBean` class:

```java
public class ExampleBean {

    // a private constructor
    private ExampleBean(...) {
        ...
    }

    // a static factory method; the arguments to this method can be
    // considered the dependencies of the bean that is returned,
    // regardless of how those arguments are actually used.
    public static ExampleBean createInstance (
        AnotherBean anotherBean, YetAnotherBean yetAnotherBean, int i) {

        ExampleBean eb = new ExampleBean (...);
        // some other operations...
        return eb;
    }
}
```

Arguments to the static factory method are supplied by `<constructor-arg/>` elements, exactly the same as if a constructor had actually been used. The type of the class being returned by the factory method does not have to be of the same type as the class that contains the static factory method (although, in this example, it is). An instance (non-static) factory method can be used in an essentially identical fashion (aside from the use of the `factory-bean` attribute instead of the `class` attribute).
### 1.4.2 Dependencies and Configuration in Detail

As mentioned in the previous section, you can define bean properties and constructor arguments as references to other managed beans (collaborators) or as values defined inline. Spring's XML-based configuration metadata supports sub-element types within its `<property/>` and `<constructor-arg/>` elements for this purpose.
#### Straight Values (Primitives, Strings, and so on)

The `value` attribute of the `<property/>` element specifies a property or constructor argument as a human-readable string representation. Spring's conversion service is used to convert these values from a `String` to the actual type of the property or argument. The following example shows various values being set:

```xml
<bean id="myDataSource" class="org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource" destroy-method="close">
    <!-- results in a setDriverClassName(String) call -->
    <property name="driverClassName" value="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"/>
    <property name="url" value="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb"/>
    <property name="username" value="root"/>
    <property name="password" value="masterkaoli"/>
</bean>
```

The following example uses the p-namespace for even more succinct XML configuration:

```xml
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xmlns:p="http://www.springframework.org/schema/p"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
    https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

    <bean id="myDataSource" class="org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource"
        destroy-method="close"
        p:driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
        p:url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb"
        p:username="root"
        p:password="masterkaoli"/>

</beans>
```

The preceding XML is more succinct. However, typos are discovered at runtime rather than design time, unless you use an IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA or the Spring Tools for Eclipse) that supports automatic property completion when you create bean definitions. Such IDE assistance is highly recommended.

You can also configure a `java.util.Properties` instance, as follows:

```xml
<bean id="mappings"
    class="org.springframework.context.support.PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer">

    <!-- typed as a java.util.Properties -->
    <property name="properties">
        <value>
            jdbc.driver.className=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
            jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
        </value>
    </property>
</bean>
```

The Spring container converts the text inside the `<value/>` element into a `java.util.Properties` instance by using the JavaBeans `PropertyEditor` mechanism. This is a nice shortcut, and is one of a few places where the Spring team do favor the use of the nested `<value/>` element over the `value` attribute style.
##### The `idref` element

The `idref` element is simply an error-proof way to pass the `id` (a string value - not a reference) of another bean in the container to a `<constructor-arg/>` or `<property/>` element. The following example shows how to use it:

```xml
<bean id="theTargetBean" class="..."/>

<bean id="theClientBean" class="...">
    <property name="targetName">
        <idref bean="theTargetBean"/>
    </property>
</bean>
```

The preceding bean definition snippet is exactly equivalent (at runtime) to the following snippet:

```xml
<bean id="theTargetBean" class="..." />

<bean id="client" class="...">
    <property name="targetName" value="theTargetBean"/>
</bean>
```

The first form is preferable to the second, because using the `idref` tag lets the container validate at deployment time that the referenced, named bean actually exists. In the second variation, no validation is performed on the value that is passed to the `targetName` property of the `client` bean. Typos are only discovered (with most likely fatal results) when the `client` bean is actually instantiated. If the `client` bean is a prototype bean, this typo and the resulting exception may only be discovered long after the container is deployed.

A common place (at least in versions earlier than Spring 2.0) where the `<idref/>` element brings value is in the configuration of AOP interceptors in a `ProxyFactoryBean` bean definition. Using `<idref/>` elements when you specify the interceptor names prevents you from misspelling an interceptor ID.
#### References to Other Beans (Collaborators)

The `ref` element is the final element inside a `<constructor-arg/>` or `<property/>` definition element. Here, you set the value of the specified property of a bean to be a reference to another bean (a collaborator) managed by the container. The referenced bean is a dependency of the bean whose property is to be set, and it is initialized on demand as needed before the property is set. (If the collaborator is a singleton bean, it may already be initialized by the container.) All references are ultimately a reference to another object. Scoping and validation depend on whether you specify the ID or name of the other object through the `bean` of `parent` attribute.

Specifying the target bean through the `bean` attribute of the `<ref/>` tag is the most general form and allows creation of a reference to any bean in the same container or parent container, regardless of whether it is in the same XML file. The value of the `bean` attribute may be the same as the `id` attribute of the target bean or be the same as one of the values in the `name` attribute of the target bean. The following example shows how to use a `ref` element:

```xml
<ref bean="someBean"/>
```

Specifying the target bean through the `parent` attribute creates a reference to a bean that is in a parent container of the current container. The value of the `parent` attribute may be the same as either the `id` attribute of the target bean or one of the values in the `name` attribute of the target bean. The target bean must be in a parent container of the current one. You should use this bean reference variant mainly when you have a hierarchy of containers and you want to wrap an existing bean in a parent container with a proxy that has the same name as the parent bean. The following pair of listings shows how to use the `parent` attribute:

```xml
<!-- in the parent context -->
<bean id="accountService" class="com.something.SimpleAccountService">
    <!-- insert dependencies as required as here -->
</bean>
```

```xml
<!-- in the child (descendant) context -->
<bean id="accountService" <!-- bean name is the same as the parent bean -->
    class="org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactoryBean">
    <property name="target">
        <ref parent="accountService"/> <!-- notice how we refer to the parent bean -->
    </property>
    <!-- insert other configuration and dependencies as required here -->
</bean>
```
#### Inner Beans

A `<bean/>` element inside the `<property/>` or `<constructor-arg/>` elements defines an inner bean, as the following example shows:

```xml
<bean id="outer" class="...">
    <!-- instead of using a reference to a target bean, simply define the target bean inline -->
    <property name="target">
        <bean class="com.example.Person"> <!-- this is the inner bean -->
            <property name="name" value="Fiona Apple"/>
            <property name="age" value="25"/>
        </bean>
    </property>
</bean>
```

An inner bean definition does not require a defined ID or name. If specified, the container does not use such a value as an indentifier. The container also ignores the `scope` flag on creation, because inner beans are always anonymous and are always created with the outer bean. It is not possible to access inner beans independently or to inject them into collaborating beans other than into the enclosing bean.

As a corner case, it is possible to receive destruction callbacks from a custom scope - for example, for a request-scoped inner bean contained within a singleton bean. The creation of the inner bean instance is tied to its containing bean, but destruction callbacks let it participate in the request scope's lifecycle. This is not a common scenario. Inner beans typically simply share their containing bean's scope.
#### Collections

The `<list/>`, `<set/>`, `<map/>`, and `<props/>` elements set the properties and arguments of the Java `Collection` types `List`, `Set`, `Map`, and `Properties`, respectively. The following example shows how to use them:

```xml
<bean id="moreComplexObject" class="example.ComplexObject">
    <!-- results in a setAdminEmails(java.util.Properties) call -->
    <property name="adminEmails">
        <props>
            <prop key="administrator">administrator@example.org</prop>
            <prop key="support">support@example.org</prop>
            <prop key="development">development@example.org</prop>
        </props>
    </property>
    <!-- results in a setSomeList(java.util.List) call -->
    <property name="someList">
        <list>
            <value>a list element followed by a reference</value>
            <ref bean="myDataSource" />
        </list>
    </property>
    <!-- results in a setSomeMap(java.util.Map) call -->
    <property name="someMap">
        <map>
            <entry key="an entry" value="just some string"/>
            <entry key ="a ref" value-ref="myDataSource"/>
        </map>
    </property>
    <!-- results in a setSomeSet(java.util.Set) call -->
    <property name="someSet">
        <set>
            <value>just some string</value>
            <ref bean="myDataSource" />
        </set>
    </property>
</bean>
```

The value of a map key or value, or a set value, can also be any of the following elements:

```xml
bean | ref | idref | list | set | map | props | value | null
```
##### Collection Merging

The Spring container also supports merging collections. An application developer can define a parent `<list/>`, `<map/>`, `<set/>` or `<props/>` element and have child `<list/>`, `<map/>`, `<set/>` or `<props/>` elements inherit and override values from the parent collection. That is, the child collection's values are the result of merging the elements of the parent and child collections, with the child's collection elements overriding values specified in the parent collection.

The following example demonstrates collection merging:

```xml
<beans>
    <bean id="parent" abstract="true" class="example.ComplexObject">
        <property name="adminEmails">
            <props>
                <prop key="administrator">administrator@example.com</prop>
                <prop key="support">support@example.com</prop>
            </props>
        </property>
    </bean>
    <bean id="child" parent="parent">
        <property name="adminEmails">
            <!-- the merge is specified on the child collection definition -->
            <props merge="true">
                <prop key="sales">sales@example.com</prop>
                <prop key="support">support@example.co.uk</prop>
            </props>
        </property>
    </bean>
<beans>
```

Notice the use of the `merge=true` attribute on the `<props/>` element of the `adminEmails` property of the `child` bean definition. When the `child` bean is resolved and instantiated by the container, the resulting instance has an `adminEmails` `Properties` collection that contains the result of merging the child's `adminEmails` collection with the parent's `adminEmails` collection. The following list shows the result:

```xml
administrator=administrator@example.com
sales=sales@example.com
support=support@example.co.uk
```

The child `Properties` collection's value set inherits all property elements from the parent `<props/>`, and the child's value for the `support` value overrides the value in the parent collection.

This merging behavior applies similarly to the `<list/>`, `<map/>`, and `<set/>` collection types. In the specific case of the `<list/>` element, the semantics associated with the `List` collection type (that is, the notion of an `ordered` collection of values) is maintained. The parent's values precede all of the child list's values. In the case of the `Map`, `Set` and `Properties` collection types, no ordering exists. Hence, no ordering semantics are in effect for the collection types that underlie the associated `Map`, `Set` and `Properties` implementation types that the container uses internally.
##### Limitations of Collection Merging

You cannot merge different collection types (such as a `Map` and a `List`). If you do attempt to do so, an appropriate `Exception` is thrown. The `merge` attribute must be specified on the lower, inherited, child definition. Specifying the `merge` attribute on a parent collection definition is redundant and does not result in the desired merging.
##### Strongly-typed collection

With the introduction of generic types in Java 5, you can use strongly typed collections. That is, it is possible to declare a `Collection` type such that it can only contain (for example) `String` elements. If you use Spring to dependency-inject a strongly-typed `Collection` into a bean, you can take advantage of Spring's type-conversion support such that the elements of your strongly-typed `Collection` instances are converted to the appropriate type prior to being added to the `Collection`. The following Java class and bean definition show how to do so:

```java
public class SomeClass {
    private Map<String, Float> accounts;

    public void setAccounts(Map<String, Float> accounts) {
        this.accounts = accounts;
    }
}
```

```xml
<beans>
    <bean id="something" class="x.y.SomeClass">
        <property name="accounts">
            <map>
                <entry key="one" value="9.99"/>
                <entry key="two" value="2.75"/>
                <entry key="six" value="3.99"/>
            </map>
        </property>
    </bean>
</beans>
```

When the `accounts` property of the `something` bean is prepared for injection, the generics information about the element type of the strongly-typed `Map<String, Float>` is available by reflection. Thus, Spring's type conversion infrastructure recognizes the various value elements as being of type `Float`, and the string value (`9.99`, `2.75`, and `3.99`) are converted into an actual `Float` type.
#### Null and Empty String Values

Spring treats empty arguments for properties and the like as empty `Strings`. The following XML-based configuration metadata snippet sets the `mail` property to the empty `String` value ("").

```xml
<bean class="ExampleBean">
    <property name="email" value=""/>
</bean>
```

The preceding example is equivalent to the following Java code:

```java
exampleBean.setEmail("");
```

The `<null/>` element handles `null` values. The following listing shows an example:

```xml
<bean class="ExampleBean">
    <property name="email">
        <null/>
    </property>
</bean>
```

The preceding configuration is equivalent to the following Java code:

```java
exampleBean.setEmail(null);
```
#### XML Shortcut with the p-namespace

The p-namespace lets you use the `bean` element's attributes (instead of nexted `<property/>` elements) to describe your property values collaborating beans, or both.

Spring supports extensible configuration formats with namespaces, which are based on an XML Schema definition. The `beans` configuration format discussed in this chapter is defined in an XML Schema document. However, the p-namespace is not defined in an XSD file and exists only in the core of Spring.

The following example shows two XML snippets (the first uses standard XML format and the second uses the p-namespace) that resolve to the same result:

```xml
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xmlns:p="http://www.springframework.org/schema/p"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
        https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

    <bean name="classic" class="com.example.ExampleBean">
        <property name="email" value="someone@somewhere.com"/>
    </bean>

    <bean name="p-namespace" class="com.example.ExampleBean"
        p:email="someone@somewhere.com"/>
</beans>
```

The example shows an attribute in the p-namespace called `email` in the bean definition. This tells Spring to include a property declaration. As previously mentioned, the p-namespace does not have a schema definition, so you can set the name of the attribute to the property name.

This next example includes two more bean definitions that both have a reference to another bean:

```xml
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xmlns:p="http://www.springframework.org/schema/p"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
        https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

    <bean name="john-classic" class="com.example.Person">
        <property name="name" value="John Doe"/>
        <property name="spouse" ref="jane"/>
    </bean>

    <bean name="john-modern"
        class="com.example.Person"
        p:name="John Doe"
        p:spouse-ref="jane"/>

    <bean name="jane" class="com.example.Person">
        <property name="name" value="Jane Doe"/>
    </bean>
</beans>
```

This example includes not only a property value using the p-namespace but also uses a special format to declare property references. Whereas the first bean definition uses `<property name="spouse" ref="jane"/>` to create a reference from bean `john` to bean `jane`, the second bean definition uses `p:spouse-ref="jane"` as an attribute to do the exact same thing. In this case, `spouse` is the property name, whereas the `-ref` part indicates that this is not a straight value but rather a reference to another bean.

>> The p-namespace is not as flexible as the standard XML format. For example, the format for declaring property references clashes with properties that end in `Ref`, whereas the standard XML format does not. We recommend that you choose yoru approach carefully and communicate this to your team members to avoid producing XML documents that use all three approaches at the same time.
#### XML Shortcut with the c-namespace

The c-namespace, introduced in Spring 3.1, allows inlined attributes for configuring the constructor arguments rather then nested `constructor-arg` elements.

The following example uses the `c:` namespace to do the same thing as the form constructor-based dependency injection:

```xml
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xmlns:c="http://www.springframework.org/schema/c"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
        https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

    <bean id="beanTwo" class="x.y.ThingTwo"/>
    <bean id="beanThree" class="x.y.ThingThree"/>

    <!-- traditional declaration with optional argument names -->
    <bean id="beanOne" class="x.y.ThingOne">
        <constructor-arg name="thingTwo" ref="beanTwo"/>
        <constructor-arg name="thingThree" ref="beanThree"/>
        <constructor-arg name="email" value="something@somewhere.com"/>
    </bean>

    <!-- c-namespace declaration with argument names -->
    <bean id="beanOne" class="x.y.ThingOne" c:thingTwo-ref="beanTwo"
        c:thingThree-ref="beanThree" c:email="something@somewhere.com"/>

</beans>
```

The `c:` namespace uses the same conventions as the `p:` one (a trailing `-ref` for bean references) for setting the constructor arguments by their names. Similarly, it needs to be declared in the XML file even though it is not defined in an XSD schema (it exists inside the SPring core)

For the rare cases where the constructor argument names are not available (usually if the bytecode was compiled without debugging information), you can use fallback to the argument indexes, as follows:

```xml
<!-- c-namespace index declaration -->
<bean id="beanOne" class="x.y.ThingOne" c:_0-ref="beanTwo" c:_1-ref="beanThree"
    c:_2="something@somewhere.com"/>
```

>> Due to the XML grammer, the index notation requires the presence of the leading `_`, as XML attribute names cannot start with a number (even though some IDEs allow it). A corresponding index notation is also available for `<constructor-arg>` elements but not commonly used since the plain order of declaration is usually sufficient there.

In practice, the constructor resolution mechanism is quite efficient in matching arguments, so unless you really need to, we recommend using the same notation through-out your configuration.
#### Compound Property Names

You can use compound or nested property names when you set bean properties, as long as all components of the path except the final property name are not `null`. Confider the following bean definition:

```xml
<bean id="something" class="things.ThingOne">
    <property name="fred.bob.sammy" value="123" />
</bean>
```

The `something` bean has a `fred` property, which has a `bob` property, which has a `sammy` property, and that final `sammy` property is being set to a value of `123`. In order for this to work, the `fred` property of `something` and the `bob` property of `fred` must not be `null` after the bean is constructed. Otherwise, a `NullPointerException` is thrown.
### 1.4.3 Using `depends-on`

If a bean is a dependency of another-bean, that usually means that one bean is set as a property of another. Typically you accomplish this with the `<ref/>` element in XML-based configuration metadata. However, sometimes dependencies between beans are less direct. An example is when a static initializer in a class needs to be triggered, such as for database driver registration. The `depends-on` attribute can explicitly force one or more beans to be initialized before the bean using this element is initialized. The following example uses the `depends-on` attribute to express a dependency on a single bean:

```xml
<bean id="beanOne" class="ExampleBean" depends-on="manager"/>
<bean id="manager" class="ManagerBean" />
```

To express a dependency on multiple beans, supply a list of bean names as the value of the `depends-on` attribute (commas, whitespace, and semicolons are valid delimiters):

```xml
<bean id="beanOne" class="ExampleBean" depends-on="manager,accountDao">
    <property name="manager" ref="manager" />
</bean>

<bean id="manager" class="ManagerBean" />
<bean id="accountDao" class="x.y.jdbc.JdbcAccountDao" />
```

>> The `depends-on` attribute can specify both an initialization-time dependency and, in the case of singleton beans only, a corresponding destruction-time dependency. Dependent beans that define a `depends-on` relationship with a given bean are destroyed first, prior to the given bean itself being destroyed. Thus, `depends-on` can also control shutdown order.
### 1.4.4 Lazy-initialized Beans

By default, `ApplicationContext` implementations eagerly create and configure all singleton beans as part of the initialization process. Generally, this pre-instantiation is desirable, because errors in the configuration or surrounding environment are discovered immediately, as opposed to hours or even days later. When this behavior is not desirable, you can prevent pre-instantiation of a singleton bean by marking the bean definition as being lazy-initialized. A lazy-initialized bean tells the IoC container to create a bean instance when it is first requested, rather than at startup.

In XML, this behavior is controlled by the `lazy-init` attribute on the `<bean/>` element, as the following example shows:

```xml
<bean id="lazy" class="com.something.ExpensiveToCreateBean" lazy-init="true"/>
<bean name="not.lazy" class="com.something.AnotherBean"/>
```

When the preceding configuration is consumed by an `ApplicationContext`, the `lazy` bean is not eagerly pre-instantiated when the `ApplicationContext` starts, whereas the `not.lazy` bean is eagerly pre-instantiated.

However, when a lazy-initialized bean is a dependency of a singleton bean that is not lazy-initialized, the `ApplicationContext` creates the lazy-initialized bean at startup, because it must satisfy the singleton's dependencies. The lazy-initialized bean is injected into a singleton bean elsewhere that is not laze-initialized.

You can also control lazy-initialization at the container level by using the `default-lazy-init` attribute on the `<beans/>` element, as the following example shows:

```xml
<beans default-lazy-init="true">
    <!-- no beans will be pre-instantiated... -->
</beans>
```
### 1.4.5 Autowiring Collaborators

The Spring container can autowire relationships between collaborating beans. You can let Spring resolve collaborators (other beans) automatically for your bean by inspecting the contents of the `ApplicationContext`. Autowiring has the following advantages:

(1) Autowiring can significantly reduce the need to specify properties or constructor arguments. (Other mechanisms such as a bean template are also valuable in this regard.)

(2) Autowiring can update a configuration as your objects evolve. For example, if you need to add a dependency to a class, that dependency can be satisfied automatically without you needing to modify the configuration. Thus autowiring can be especially useful during development, without negating the option of switching to explicit wiring when the code base becomes more stable.

When using XML-based configuration metadata, you can specify the autowire mode for a bean definition with the `autowire` attribute of the `<bean/>` element. The autowiring functionality has four modes. You specify autowiring per bean and can thus choose which ones to autowire. The following table describes the four autowring modes:

| Mode | Explanation |
| :-: | :-: |
| `no` | (Defualt) No autowiring. Bean references must be defined by `ref` elements. Changing the default setting is not recommended for larger deployments, because specifying collaborators explicitly gives greater control and clarity. To some extent, it documents the structure of a system. |
| `byname` | Autowiring by property name. Spring looks for a bean with the same name as the property that needs to be autowired. For example, if a bean definition is set to autowire by name and it contains a `master` property (that is, it has a `setMaster(...)` method), Spring looks for a bean definition named `master` and uses it to set the property. |
| `byType` | Lets a property be autowired if exactly one bean of the property type exists in the container. If more than one exists, a fatal exception is thrown, which indicates that you may not use `byType` autowiring for that bean. If there are no matching beans, noting happends (the property is not set). |
| `constructor` | Analogous to `byType` but applies to constructor arguments. If there is not exactly one bean of the constructor argument type in the container, a fatal error is raised. |

With `byType` or `constructor` autowiring mode, you can wire arrays and typed collections. In such cases, all autowire candidates within the container that match the expected type are provided to satisfy the dependency. You can autowire strongly-typed `Map` instances if the expected key type is `String`. An autowired `Map` instance's values consist of all bean instances that match the expected type, and the `Map` instance's keys contain the corresponding bean names.
#### Limitations and Disadvantages of Autowiring

Autowiring works best when it is used consistently across a project. If autowiring is not used in general, it might be confusing to developers to use it to wire only one or two bean definitions.

Consider the limitations and disadvantages of autowiring:

(1) Explicit dependencies in `property` and `constructor-arg` setting always override autowiring. You cannot autowire simple properties such as primitives, `Strings`, and `Classes` (an arrays of such simple properties). This limitation is by-design.

(2) Autowiring is less exact than explicit wiring. Although, as noted in the earlier table, Spring is careful to avoid guessing in case of ambiguity that might have unexpected results. The relationships between your Spring-managed objects are no longer documented explicitly.

(3) Wiring information may not be available to tools that may generate documentation from a Spring container.

(4) Multiple bean definitions within the container may match the type specified by the setter method or constructor argument to be autowired. For arrays, collections, or `Map` instances, this is not necessarily a problem. However, for dependencies that expect a single value, this ambiguity is not arbitrarily resolved. If no unique bean definition is available, an exception is thrown.

In the latter scenario, you have several options:

(1) Abandon autowiring in favor of explicit wiring.

(2) Avoid autowiring for a bean definition by setting its `autowire-candidate` attributes to `false`.

(3) Designate a single bean definition as the primary candidate by setting the `primary` attribute of its `<bean/>` element to `true`.

(4) Implement the more fine-grained control available with annotation-based configuration.
#### Excluding a Bean from Autowiring

On a per-bean basis, you can exclude a bean from autowiring. In Spring's XML format, set the `autowire-candidate` attribute of the `<bean/>` element to `false`. The container makes that specific bean definition unavailable to the autowiring infrastructure (including annotation style configurations such as `@Autowired`).

>> The `autowire-candidate` attribute is designed to only affect type-based autowiring. It does not affect explicit references by name, which get resolved even if the specified bean is not marked as an autowire candidate. As a consequence, autowiring by name nevertheless injects a bean if the name matches.

You can also limit autowire candidates based on pattern-matching against bean names. The top-level `<beans/>` element accepts one or more patterns within its `default-autowire-candidates` attribute. For example, to limit autowire candidate status to any bean whose name ends with `Repository`, provide a value of `*Repository`. To provide multiple patterns, define them in a comma-separated list. An explicit value of `true` or `false` for a bean definition's `autowire-candidate` attribute always takes precedence. For such beans, the pattern matching rules do not apply.

These techniques are useful for beans that you never want to be injected into other beans by autowiring. It does not mean that an excluded bean cannot itself be configured by using autowiring. Rather, the bean itself is not a candidate for autowring other beans.
### 1.4.6 Method Injection

In most application scenarios, most beans in the container are singletons. When a singleton bean needs to collaborate with another singleton bean or a non-singleton bean needs to collaborate with another non-singleton bean, you typically handle the dependency by defining one bean as a property of the other. A problem arises when the bean lifecycle are different. Suppose singleton bean A needs to use non-singleton (prototype) bean B, perhaps on each method invocation on A. The container creates the singleton bean A only once, and thus only gets one opportunity to set the properties. The container cannot provide bean A with a new instance of bean B every time one is needed.

A solution is to forego some inversion of control. You can make bean A aware of the container by implementing the `ApplicationContextAware` interface, and by making a `getBean("B")` call to the container ask for (a typically new) bean B instance every time bean A needs it. The following example shows this approach:

```java
import org.springframework.beans.BeansException;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContextAware;

public class CommandManager implements ApplicationContextAware {
    private ApplicationContext applicationContext;

    public Object process(Map commandState) {
        // grab a new instance of the appropriate Command
        Command command = createCommand();
        // set the state on the (hopefully brand new) Command instance
        command.setState(commandState);
        return command.execute();
    }

    protected Command createCommand() {
        // notice the Spring API dependency!
        return this.applicationContext.getBean("command", Command.class);
    }

    public void setApplicationContext(
            ApplicationContext applicationContext) throws BeansException {
        this.applicationContext = applicationContext;
    }
}
```

The preceding is not desirable, because the business code is aware of and coupled to the Spring Framework. Method Injection, a somewhat advanced feature of the Spring IoC container, lets you handle this use case cleanly.
#### Lookup Method Injection

Lookup method injection is the ability of the container to override methods on container-managed beans and return the lookup result for another named bean in the container. The lookup typically involves a prototype bean, as in the scenario described in the preceding section. The Spring Framework implements this method injection by using bytecode generation from the CGLIB library to dynamically generate a subclass that overrides the method.

>> For this dynamic sublcassing to work, the class that the Spring bean container subclasses cannot be `final`, and the method to be overriden cannot be `final`, either.

>> Unit-testing a class that has an `abstract` method requires you to subclass the class yourself and to supply a stub implementation of the `abstract` method.

>> Concrete methods are also necessary for component scanning, which requires concrete classes to pick up.

>> A further key limitation is that lookup methods do not work with factory methods and in particular not with `@Bean` methods in configuration classes, since, in that case, the container is not in charge of creating the instance and therefore cannot create a runtime-generated subclass on the fly.

In the case of the `CommandManager` class in the previous code snippet, the Spring container dynamically overrides the implementation of the `createCommand()` method. The `CommandManager` class does not have any Spring dependencies, as the reworked example shows:

```java
public abstract class CommandManager {
    public Object process(Object commandState) {
        // grab a new instance of the appropriate Command interface
        Command command = createCommand();
        // set the state on the (hopefully brand new) Command instance
        command.setState(commandState);
        return command.execute();
    }

    // okay... but where is the implementation of this method?
    protected abstract Command createCommand();
}
```

In the client class that containes the method to be injected (the `CommandManager` in this case), the method to be injected requires a signature of the following form:

```
<public|protected> [abstract] <return-type> theMethodName(no-arguments);
```

If the method is `abstract`, the dynamically-generated subclass implements the method. Otherwise, the dynamically-generated subclass overrides the concrete method defined in the original class. Consider the following example:

```xml
<!-- a stateful bean deployed as a prototype (non-singleton) -->
<bean id="myCommand" class="fiona.apple.AsyncCommand" scope="prototype">
    <!-- inject dependencies here as required -->
</bean>

<!-- commandProcessor uses statefulCommandHelper -->
<bean id="commandManager" class="fiona.apple.CommandManager">
    <lookup-method name="createCommand" bean="myCommand"/>
</bean>
```

The bean identified as `commandManager` calls its own `createCommand()` method whenever it needs a new instance of the `myCommand` bean. You must be careful to deploy the `myCommand` bean as a prototype if that is actually what is needed. If it is a singleton, the same instance of the `myCommand` bean is returned each time.

Alternatively, within the annotation-based component model, you can declare a lookup method through the `@Lookup` annotation, as the following example shows:

```java
public abstract class CommandManager {
    public Object process(Object commandState) {
        Command command = createCommand();
        command.setState(commandState);
        return command.execute();
    }

    @Lookup("myCommand")
    protected abstract Command createCommand();
}
```

Or, more idiomatically, you can rely on the target bean getting resolved against the declared return type of the lookup method:

```java
public abstract class CommandManager {
    public Object process(Object commandState) {
        MyCommand command = createCommand();
        command.setState(commandState);
        return command.execute();
    }

    @Lookup
    protected abstract MyCommand createCommand();
}
```

Note that you should typically declare such annotated lookup methods with a concrete stub implementation, in order for them to be compatible with Spring's component scanning rules where abstract classes get ignored by default. This limitation does not apply to explicitly registered or explicitly imported bean classes.

>> Another way of accessing differently scoped target beans is an `ObjectFactory` / `Provider` injection point.

>> You may also find the `ServiceLocatorFactoryBean` (in the `org.springframework.beans.factory.config` package) to be useful.
#### Arbitrary Method Replacement

A less useful form of method injection than lookup method injection is the ability to replace arbitrary methods in a managed bean with another method implementation.

With XML-based configuration metadata, you can use the `replaced-method` element to replace an existing method implementation with another, for a deployed bean. Consider the following class, which has a method called `computeValue` that we want to override:

```java
public class MyValueCalculator {
    public String computeValue(String input) {
        // some real code...
    }
}
```

A class that implements the `org.springframework.beans.factory.support.MethodReplacer` interface provides the new method definition, as the following example shows:

```java
/**
 * meant to be used to override the existing computeValue(String)
 * implementation in MyValueCalculator
 */
public class ReplacementComputeValue implements MethodReplacer {
    public Object reimplement(Object o, Method m, Object[] args) throws Throwable {
        // get the input value, work with it, and return a computed result
        String input = (String) args[0];
        ...
        return ...;
    }
}
```

The bean definition to deploy the original class and specify the method override would resemble the following example:

```xml
<bean id="myValueCalculator" class="x.y.z.MyValueCalculator">
    <!-- arbitrary method replacement -->
    <replaced-method name="computeValue" replacer="replacementComputeValue">
        <arg-type>String</arg-type>
    </replaced-method>
</bean>

<bean id="replacementComputeValue" class="a.b.c.ReplacementComputeValue"/>
```

You can use one or more `<arg-type/>` elements within the `<replaced-method/>` element to indicate the method signature of the method being overridden. The signature for the arguments is necessary only if the method is overloaded and multiple variants exist within the class. For convenience, the type string for an argument may be a substring of the fully qualified type name. For example, the following all match `java.lang.String`:

```java
java.lang.String
String
Str
```

Because the number of arguments is often enough to distinguish between each possible choice, this shortcut can save a lot of typing, by letting you type only the shortest string that matches an argument type.
## 1.5 Bean Scopes

When you create a bean definition, you create a recipe for creating actual instances of the class defined by that bean definition. The idea that a bean definition is a recipe is important, because it means that, as with a class, you can create many object instances from a single recipe.

You can control not only the various dependencies and configuration values that are to be plugged into an object that is created from a particular bean definition but also control the scope of the objects created from a particular bean definition. The approach is powerful and flexible, because you can choose the scope of the objects you create through configuration instead of having to bake in the scope of an object at the Java class level. Beans can be defined to be deployed in one of a number of scopes. The Spring Framework supports six scopes, four of which are available only if you use a web-aware `ApplicationContext`. You can also create a custom scope.

The following table describes the supported scopes:

| Scope | Description |
| :-: | :-: |
| singleton | (Default) Scopes a single bean definition to a single object instance for each Spring IoC container. |
| prototype | Scopes a single bean definition to any number of object instances. |
| request | Scopes a single bean definition to the lifecycle of a single HTTP request. That is, each HTTP request has its own instance of a bean created off the back of a single bean definition. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring `ApplicationContext`. |
| session | Scopes a single bean definition to the lifecycle of an HTTP `Session`. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring `ApplicationContext`. |
| application | Scopes a single bean definition to the lifecycle of a `ServletContext`. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring `ApplicationContext`. |
| websocket | Scopes a single bean definition to the lifecycle of a `WebSocket`. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring `ApplicationContext`. |

>> As of Spring 3.0, a thread scope is available but is not registered by default. For more information, see the documentation for `SimpleThreadScope`.
### 1.5.1 The Singleton Scope

Only one shared instance of a singleton bean is managed, and all requests for beans with an ID or IDs that match that bean definition result in that one specific bean instance being returned by the Spring container.

To put it another way, when you define a bean definition and it is scoped as a singleton, the Spring IoC container creates exactly one instance of the object defined by that bean definition. This single instance is stored in a cache of such singleton beans, and all subsequent requests and references for that named bean return the cached object. The following image shows how the singleton scope works:

![](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.5.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/images/singleton.png)

Spring's concept of a singleton bean differs from the singleton pattern as defined in the Gang of Four (GoF) patterns book. The GoF singleton hard-codes the scope of an object such that one and only one instance of a particular class is created per ClassLoader. The scope of the Spring singleton is best described as being per-container and per-bean. This means that, if you define one bean for a particular class in a single Spring container, the Spring container creates one and only one instance of the class defined by that bean definiion. The singleton scope is the default scope in Spring. To define a bean as a singleton in XML, you can define a bean as shown in the following example:

```xml
<bean id="accountService" class="com.something.DefaultAccountService"/>

<!-- the following is equivalent, though redundant (singleton scope is the default) -->
<bean id="accountService" class="com.something.DefaultAccountService" scope="singleton"/>
```
### 1.5.2 The Prototype Scope

The non-singleton prototype scope of bean deployment results in the creation of a new bean instance every time a request for that specific bean is made. That is, the bean is injected into another bean or you request is through a `getBean()` method call on the container. As a rule, you should use the prototype scope for all stateful beans and the singleton scope for stateless beans.

The following diagram illustrates the Spring prototype scope:

![](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.5.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/images/prototype.png)

(A data access object (DAO)) is not typically configured as a prototype, because a typical DAO does not hold any conversational state. It was easier for us to reuse the core of the singleton diagram.)

The following example defines a bean as a prototype in XML:

```xml
<bean id="accountService" class="com.something.DefaultAccountService" scope="prototype"/>
```

In contrast to the other scopes, Spring does not manage the complete lifecycle of a prototype bean. The container instantiates, configures, and otherwise assembles a prototype object and hands it to the client, with no further record of that prototype instance. Thus, although initialization lifecycle callback methods are called on all objects regardless of scope, in the case of prototypes, configured destruction lifecycle callbacks are not called. The client code must clean up prototype-scoped objects and release expensive resources that the prototype beans hold. To get the Spring container to release resources held by prototype-scoped beans, try using a custom bean post-processor, which holds a reference to beans that need to be cleaned up.

In some respects, the Spring container's role in regard to a prototype-scoped bean is a replacement for the Java `new` operator. All lifecycle management past that point must be handled by the client.
### 1.5.3 Singleton Beans with Prototype-bean Dependencies

When you use singleton-scoped beans with dependencies on prototype beans, be aware that dependencies are resolved at instantiation time. Thus, if you dependency-inject a prototype-scoped bean into a singleton-scoped bean, a new prototype bean is instantiated and then dependency-injected into the singleton bean. The prototype instance is the sole instance that is ever supplied to the singleton-scoped bean.

However, suppose you want the singleton-scoped bean to acquire a new instance of the prototype-scoped bean repeatedly at runtime. You cannot dependency-inject a prototype-scoped bean into your singleton bean, because that injection occurs only once, when the Spring container instantiates the singleton bean and resolves and injects its dependencies. If you need a new instance of a prototype bean at runtime more than once, see Method Injection.
### 1.5.4 Request, Session, Application and WebSocket Scopes

The `request`, `session`, `application`, and `websocket` scopes are available only if you use a web-aware Spring `ApplicationContext` implementation (such as `XmlWebApplicationContext`). If you use these scopes with regular Spring IoC containers, such as the `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`, an `IllegalStateException` that complains about an unknown bean scope is thrown.
#### Initial Web Configuration

To support the scoping of beans at the `request`, `session`, `application`, and `websocket` levels (web-scoped beans), some minor initial configuration is required before you define your beans. (This initial setup is not required for the standard scopes: `singleton` and `prototype`.)

How you accomplish this initial setup depends on your particular Servlet environment.

If you access scoped beans within Spring Web MVC, in effect, within a request that is processed by the Spring `DispatcherServlet`, no special setup is necessary. `DispatcherServlet` already exposes all relevant state.

If you use a Servlet 2.5 web container, with requests processed outside of Spring's `DispatcherServlet` (for example, when using JSF or Struts), you need to register the `org.springframework.web.context.request.RequestContextListener`. For Servlet 3.0+, this can be done programmatically by using the `WebApplicationInitializer` interface. Alternatively, or for older containers, add the following declaration to your web application's `web.xml` file:

```xml
<web-app>
    ...
    <listener>
        <listener-class>
            org.springframework.web.context.request.RequestContextListener
        </listener-class>
    </listener>
    ...
</web-app>
```

Alternatively, if there are issues with your listener setup, consider using Spring's `RequestContextFilter`. The filter mapping depends on the surrounding web application configuration, so you have to change it as appropriate. The following listing shows the filter part of a web application:

```xml
<web-app>
    ...
    <filter>
        <filter-name>requestContextFilter</filter-name>
        <filter-class>org.springframework.web.filter.RequestContextFilter</filter-class>
    </filter>
    <filter-mapping>
        <filter-name>requestContextFilter</filter-name>
        <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
    </filter-mapping>
    ...
</web-app>
```

`DispatcherServlet`, `RequestContextListener`, and `RequestContextFilter` all do exactly the same thing, namely bind the HTTP request object to the `Thread` that is servicing that request. This makes beans that are request- and session-scoped available further down the call chain.
#### Request Scope

Consider the following XML configuration for a bean definition:

```xml
<bean id="loginAction" class="com.something.LoginAction" scope="request"/>
```

The Spring container creates a new instance of the `LoginAction` bean by using the `LoginAction` bean definition for each and every HTTP request. That is, the `loginAction` bean is scoped at the HTTP request level. You can change the internal state of the instance that is created as much as you want, because other instances created from the same `loginAction` bean definition do not see these changes in state. They are particular to an individual request. When the request completes processing, the bean that is scoped to the request is discarded.

When using annotation-driven components or Java configuration, the `@RequestScope` annotation can be used to assign a component to the `request` scope. The following example shows how to do so:

```java
@RequestScope
@Component
public class LoginAction {
    // ...
}
```
#### Session Scope

Consider the following XML configuration for a bean definition:

```xml
<bean id="userPreferences" class="com.something.UserPreferences" scope="session"/>
```

The Spring container creates a new instance of the `UserPreferences` bean by using the `userPreferences` bean definition for the lifetime of a single HTTP `Session`. In other words, the `userPreferences` bean is effectively scoped at the HTTP `Session` level. As with request-scoped beans, you can change the internal state of the instance that is created as much as you want, knowing that other HTTP `Session` instances that are also using instances created from the same `userPreferences` bean definition do not see these changes in state, because they are particular to an individual HTTP `Session`. When the HTTP `Session` is eventually discarded, the bean that is scoped to that particular HTTP `Session` is also discarded.

When using annotation-driven components or Java configuration, you can use the `@SessionScope` annotation to assign a component to the `session` scope.

```java
@SessionScope
@Component
public class UserPreferences {
    // ...
}
```
#### Application Scope

Consider the following XML configuration for a bean definition:

```xml
<bean id="appPreferences" class="com.something.AppPreferences" scope="application"/>
```

The Spring container creates a new instance of the `AppPreferences` bean by using the `appPreferences` bean definition once for the entire web application. That is, the `appPreferences` bean is scoped at the `ServletContext` level and stored as a regular `ServletConext` attribute. This is somewhat similar to a Spring singleton bean but differs in two important ways: It is a singleton per `ServletConext`, not per Spring `ApplicationContext` (for which there may be several in any given web application), and it is actually exposed and therefore visible as a `ServletConext` attribute.

When using annotation-driven components or Java configuration, you can use the `@ApplicationScope` annotation to assign a component to the `application` scope. The following example shows how to do so:

```java
@ApplicationScope
@Component
public class AppPreferences {
    // ...
}
```
#### Scoped Beans as Dependencies

The Spring IoC container manages not only the instantiation of your objects (beans), but also the wiring up of collaborators (or dependencies). If you want to inject (for example) an HTTP request-scoped bean into another bean of a longer-lived scope, you may choose to inject an AOP proxy in place of the scoped bean. That is, you need to inject a proxy object that exposes the same public interfaces as the scoped object but that can also retrieve the real target object from the relevant scope (such as an HTTP request) and delegate method calls onto the real Object.

>> You may also use `<aop:scoped-proxy/>` between beans that are scoped as `singleton`, with the reference then going through an intermediate proxy that is serializable and therefore able to re-obtain the target singleton bean on deserialization.

>> When declaring `<aop:scoped-proxy/>` against a bean of scope `prototype`, every method call on the shared proxy leads to the creation of a new target instance to which the call is then being forwarded.

>> Also, scoped proxies are not the only way to access beans from shorter scopes in a lifecycle-safe fashion. You may also declare your injection point (that is, the constructor or setter argument or autowired field) as `ObjectFactor<MyTargetBean>`, allowing for a `getObject()` call to retrieve the current instance on demand every time it is needed - without holding on to the instance or storing it separately.

>> As an extended variant, you may declare `ObjectProvider<MyTargetBean>`, which delivers several additional access variants, including `getIfAvailable` and `getIfUnique`.

>> The JSR-330 variant of this is called `Provider` and is used with a `Provider<MyTargetBean>` declaration and a corresponding `get()` call for every retrieval attempt.

The configuration in the following example is only one line, but it is important to understand the "why" as well as the "how" behind it:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xmlns:aop="http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
        https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop
        https://www.springframework.org/schema/aop/spring-aop.xsd">

    <!-- an HTTP Session-scoped bean exposed as a proxy -->
    <bean id="userPreferences" class="com.something.UserPreferences" scope="session">
        <!-- instructs the container to proxy the surrounding bean -->
        <aop:scoped-proxy/>
    </bean>

    <!-- a singleton-scoped bean injected with a proxy to the above bean -->
    <bean id="userService" class="com.something.SimpleUserService">
        <!-- a reference to the proxied userPreferences bean -->
        <property name="userPreferences" ref="userPreferences"/>
    </bean>
</beans>
```

To create such a proxy, you insert a child `<aop:scoped-proxy/>` element into a scoped bean definition. Why do definitions of beans scoped at the `request`, `session` and custom-scope levels require the `<aop:scoped-proxy/>` element? Consider the following singleton bean definition and contrast it with what you need to define for the aforementioned scopes (note that the following `userPreferences` bean definition as it stands is incomplete):

```xml
<bean id="userPreferences" class="com.something.UserPreferences" scope="session"/>

<bean id="userManager" class="com.something.UserManager">
    <property name="userPreferences" ref="userPreferences"/>
</bean>
```

In the preceding example, the singleton bean (`userManager`) is injected with a reference to the HTTP `Session`-scoped bean (`userPreferences`). The salient point here is that the `userManager` bean is singleton: it is instantiated exactly once per container, and its dependencies (in this case only one, the `userPreferences` bean) are also injected only once. This means that the `userManager` bean operates only on the exact same `userPreferences` object (that is, the one with which it was originally injected).

This is not the behavior you want when injecting a shorter-lived scoped bean into a longer-lived scoped bean (for example, injecting an HTTP `Session`-scoped collaborating bean as a dependency into singleton bean). Rather, you need a single `userManager` object, and, for the lifetime of an HTTP `Session`, you need a `userPreferences` object that is specific to the HTTP `Session`. Thus, the container creates an object that exposes the exact same public interface as the `UserPreferences` class (ideally an object that is a `UserPreferences` instance), which can fetch the real `UserPreferences` object from the scoping mechanism (HTTP request, `Session`, and so forth). The container injects this proxy object into the `userManager` bean, which is unaware that this `UserPreferences` reference is a proxy. In this example, when a `UserManager` instance invokes a method on the dependency-injected `UserPreferences` object, it is actually invoking a method on the proxy. The proxy then feches the real `UserPreferences` object from (in this case) the HTTP `Session` and delegates the method invocation onto the retrieved real `UserPreferences` object.

Thus, you need the following (correct and complete) configuration when injecting `request-` and `session-scoped` beans into collaborating objects, as the following example shows:

```xml
<bean id="userPreferences" class="com.something.UserPreferences" scope="session">
    <aop:scoped-proxy/>
</bean>

<bean id="userManager" class="com.something.UserManager">
    <property name="userPreferences" ref="userPreferences"/>
</bean>
```
##### Choosing the Type of Proxy to Create

By default, when the Spring container creates a proxy for a bean that is marked up with the `<aop:scoped-proxy/>` element, a CGLIB-based class proxy is created.

>> CGLIB proxies intercept only public method calls! Do not call non-public methods on such a proxy. They are not delegated to the actual scoped target object.

Alternatively, you can configure the Spring container to create standard JDK interface-based proxies for such scoped beans, by specifying `false` for the value of the `proxy-target-class` attribute of the `<aop:scoped-proxy/>` element. Using JDK interface-based proxies means that you do not need additional libraries in your application classpath to affect such proxying. However, it also means that the class of the scoped bean must implement at least one interface and that all collaborators into which the scoped bean is injected must reference the bean through one of its interfaces. The following example shows a proxy based on an inerface:

```xml
<!-- DefaultUserPreferences implements the UserPreferences interface -->
<bean id="userPreferences" class="com.stuff.DefaultUserPreferences" scope="session">
    <aop:scoped-proxy proxy-target-class="false"/>
</bean>

<bean id="userManager" class="com.stuff.UserManager">
    <property name="userPreferences" ref="userPreferences"/>
</bean>
```
### 1.5.5 Custom Scopes

The bean scoping mechanism is extensible. You can define your own scopes or even redefine existing scopes, although the latter is considered bad practice and you cannot override the built-in `singleton` and `prototype` scopes.
#### Creating a Custom Scope

To integrate your custom scopes into the Spring container, you need to implement the `org.springframework.beans.factory.config.Scope` interface, which is described in this section. For an idea of how to implement your own scopes, see the `Scope` implementations that are supplied with the Spring Framework itself and the `Scope` javadoc, which explains the methods you need to implement in more detail.

The `Scope` interface has four methods to get objects from the scope, remove them from the scope, and let them be destroyed.

The session scope implementation, for example, returns the session-scoped bean (if it does not exist, the method returns a new instance of the bean, after having bound it to the session for future reference). The following method returns the object from the underlying scope:

```java
Object get(String name, ObjectFactory<?> objectFactory)
```

The session scope implementation, for example, removes the session-scoped bean from the underlying session. The object should be returned, but you can return null if the object with the specified name is not found. Thw following method removes the object from the underlying scope:

```java
Object remove(String name)
```

The following method registers the callbacks the scope should execute when it is destroyed or when the specific object in the scope is destroyed:

```java
void registerDestructionCallback(String name, Runnable destructionCallback)
```

The following method obtains the conversation identifier for the underlying scope:

```java
String getConversationId()
```

The identifier is different for each scope. For a session scoped implementation, this identifier can be the session identifier.
#### Using a Custom Scope

After you write and test one or more custom `Scope` implementations, you need to make the Spring container aware of your new scopes. The following method is the central method to register a new `Scope` with the Spring container:

```java
void registerScope(String scopeName, Scope scope);
```

This method is declared on the `ConfigurableBeanFactory` interface, which is available through the `BeanFactory` property on most of the concrete `ApplicationContext` implementations that ship with Spring.

The first argument to the `registerScope(...)` method is the unique name associated with a scope. Excmples of such names in the Spring container itself are `singleton` and `prototype`. The second argument to the `registerScope(...)` method is an actual instance of the custom `Scope` implementation that you wish to register and use.

Suppose that you write your custom `Scope` implementation, and then register it as shown in the next example.

>> The next example uses `SimpleThreadScope`, which is included with Spring but is not registered by default. The instructions would be the same for your own custom `Scope` implementations.

```java
Scope threadScope = new SimpleThreadScope();
beanFactory.registerScope("thread", threadScope);
```

You can then create bean definitions that adhere to the scoping rules of your custom `Scope`, as follows:

```xml
<bean id="..." class="..." scope="thread">
```

With a custom `Scope` implementation, you are not limited to programmatic registration of the scope. You can also do the `Scope` registration declaratively, by using the `CustomScopeConfigurer` class, as the following example shows:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xmlns:aop="http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
        https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop
        https://www.springframework.org/schema/aop/spring-aop.xsd">

    <bean class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.CustomScopeConfigurer">
        <property name="scopes">
            <map>
                <entry key="thread">
                    <bean class="org.springframework.context.support.SimpleThreadScope"/>
                </entry>
            </map>
        </property>
    </bean>

    <bean id="thing2" class="x.y.Thing2" scope="thread">
        <property name="name" value="Rick"/>
        <aop:scoped-proxy/>
    </bean>

    <bean id="thing1" class="x.y.Thing1">
        <property name="thing2" ref="thing2"/>
    </bean>

</beans>
```

>> When you place `<aop:scoped-proxy/>` in a `FactoryBean` implementation, it is the factory bean itself that is scoped, not he object returned from `getObject()`.
## 1.6 Customizing the Nature of a Bean

The Spring Framework provides a number of interfaces you can use to customize the nature of a bean. This section groups them as follows:

(1) Lifecycle Callbacks

(2) `ApplicationContextAware` and `BeanNameAware`

(3) Other `Aware` Interfaces
### 1.6.1 Lifecycle Callbacks

To interact with the container's management of the bean lifecycle, you can implement the Spring `InitializingBean` and `DisposableBean` interfaces. The container calls `afterPropertiesSet()` for the former and `destroy()` for the latter to let the bean perform certain actions upon initialization and destruction of your beans.

>> The JSR-250 `@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy` annotations are generally considered best practice for receiving lifecycle callbacks in a modern Spring application. Using these annotations means that your beans are not coupled to Spring-specific interfaces.

>> If you do not want to use the JSR-250 annotations but you still want to remove coupling, consider `init-method` and `destroy-method` bean definition metadata.

Internally, the Spring Framework uses `BeanPostProcessor` implementations to process any callback interfaces it can find and call the appropriate methods. If you need custom features or other lifecycle behavior Spring does not by default offer, you can implement a `BeanPostProcessor` yourself.

In addition to the initialization and destruction callbacks, Spring-managed objects may also implement the `Lifecycle` interface so that those objects can participate in the startup and shutdown process, as driven by the container's own lifecycle.
#### Initialization Callbacks

The `org.springframework.beans.factory.InitializingBean` interface lets a bean perform initialization work after the container has set all necessary properties on the bean. The `InitializingBean` interface specifies a single method:

```java
void afterPropertiesSet() throws Exception;
```

We recommend that you do not use the `InitializingBean` interface, because it unnecessarily couples the code to Spring. Alternatively, we suggest using the `@PostConstruct` annotation or specifying a POJO initialization method. In the case of XML-based configuration metadata, you can use the `init-method` attribute to specify the name of the method that has a void no-argument signature. With Java configuration, you can use the `initMethod` attribute of `@Bean`.

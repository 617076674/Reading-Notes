>> This part of the reference documentation covers all the technologies that are absolutely integral to the Spring Framework.

>> Formost amongst these is the Spring Framework's Inversion of Control (IoC) container. A thorough treatment of the Spring Framework's IoC container is closely followed by comprehensive coverage of Spring's Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) technologies. The Spring Framework has its own AOP framework, which is conceptually easy to understand and which successfully addresses the 80% sweet spot of AOP requirements in Java enterprise programming.

>> Coverage of Spring's integration with AspectJ (currently the richest - in terms of features - and certainly most mature AOP implementation in the Java enterprise space) is also provided.
# 1. The IoC Container
## 1.1 Introducation to the Spring IoC Container and Beans

IoC is known as dependency injection (DI). It is a process whereby objects define their dependencies (that is, the other objects they work with) only through constructor arguments, arguments to a factory method, or properties that are set on the object instance after it is constructed or returned from a factory method. The container then injects those dependencies when it creates the bean. This process is fundamentally the inverse (hense the name, Inversion of Control) of the bean itself controlling the instantiation or location of its dependencies by using direct construction of classes or a mechanism such as the Service Locator pattern.

The `org.springframework.beans` and `org.springframework.context` packages are the basis for Spring Framework's IoC container. The `BeanFactory` interface provides an advanced configuration mechanism capable of managing any type of object. `ApplicationContext` is a sub-interface of `BeanFactory`. It adds:

(1) Easier integration with Spring's AOP features.

(2) Message resource handling (for use in internationalization).

(3) Event publication.

(4) Application-layer specific contexts such as the `WebApplicationContext` for use in web applications.

In the short, the `BeanFactory` provides the configuration framework and basic functionality, and the `ApplicationContext` adds more enterprise-specific functionality. The `ApplicationContext` is a complete superset of the `BeanFactory`.

In Spring, the objects that form the backbone of your application and that are managed by the Spring IoC container are called beans. A bean is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and otherwise managed by a Spring IoC container. Otherwise, a bean is simply one of many objects in your application. Beans, and the dependencies among them, are reflected in the configuration metadata used by a container.
## 1.2 Container Overview

The `org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext` interface represents the Spring IoC container and is responsible for instantiating, configuring, and assembling the beans. The container gets its instructions on what objects to instantiate, configure, and assemble by reading configuration metadata. The configuration metadata is represented in XML, Java annotations, or Java code. It lets you express the objects that compose your application and the rich interdependencies between those objects.

Several implementations of the `ApplicationContext` interface are supplied with Spring. In stand-alone applications, it is common to create an instance of `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext` or `FileSystemXmlApplicationContext`. While XML has been the traditional format for defining configuration metadata, you can instruct the container to use Java annotations or code as the metadata format by providing a small amount of XML configuration to declaratively enable support for these additional metatdata formats.


In most application scenarios, explicit user code is not required to instantiate one or more instances of a Spring IoC container. For example, in a web application scenario, a simple eight (or so) lines of boilerplate web descriptor XML in the `web.xml` file of the application typically suffices. If you use the `Spring Tools for Eclipse` (an Eclipse-powered development environment), you can easily create this boilerplate configuration with a few mouse clicks or keystrokes.

The following diagram shows a high-level view of how Spring works. Your application classes are combined with configuration metadata so that, after the `ApplicationContext` is created and initialized, you have a fully configured and executable system or application.

### 1.2.1 Configuration Metadata

As the preceding diagram shows, the Spring IoC container consumes a form of configuration metadata. This configuration metadata represents how you, as an application developer, tell the Spring container to instantiate, configure, and assemble the objects in your application.

Configuration metatdata is traditionally supplied in a simple and intuitive XML format, which is what most of this chapter uses to convey key concepts and features of the Spring IoC container.

> XML based metadata is not the only allowed form of configuration metadata. The Spring IoC container itself is totally decoupled from the format in which this configuration metadata is actually written. These days, many developers choose Java-based configuration for their Spring applications.

For information about using other forms of metadata with the Spring container, see:

(1) Annotation-based configuration: Spring 2.5 introduced support for annotation-based configuration metadata.

(2) Java-based configuration: Starting with Spring 3.0, many features provided by the Spring JavaConfig project became part of the core Spring Framework. Thus, you can define beans external to your application classed by using Java rather than XML files. To use these new features, see the `@Configuration`, `@Bean`,`@Inport` and `@DependsOn` annotations.

Spring configuration consists of at least one and typically more than one bean definition that the container must manage. XML-based configuration metadata configures these beans as `<bean/>` elements inside a top-level `<beans/>` element. Java configuration typically uses `@Bean`-annotated methods within a `@Configuration` class.

These bean definitions correspond to the actual objects that make up your application. Typically, you define service layer objects, data access objects (DAOs), presentation objects such as Stuts `Action` instances, infrastructure objects such as Hibernate `SessionFactories`, JMS `Queues`, and so forth. Typically, one does not configure fine-grained domain objects in the container, because it is usually the responsibility of DAOs and business logic to create and load domain objects. However, you can use Spring's integration with AspectJ to configure objects that have been created outside the control of an IoC container.

The following example shows the basic structure of XML-based configuration metadata:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
        https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

        <!-- The id attribute is a string that identifies the individual bean definition. -->
        <!-- The class attribute defines the type of the bean and uses the fully qualified classname. -->
    <bean id="..." class="...">  
        <!-- collaborators and configuration for this bean go here -->
    </bean>

    <bean id="..." class="...">
        <!-- collaborators and configuration for this bean go here -->
    </bean>

    <!-- more bean definitions go here -->

</beans>
```

The value of the `id` attribute refers to collaborating objects.
### 1.2.2 Instantiating a Container

The location path or paths supplied to an `ApplicationContext` constructor are resource strings that let the container load configuration metadata from a variety of external resources, such as the local file system, the Java `CLASSPATH`, and so on.

```java
ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("services.xml", "daos.xml");
```

>> After you learn about Spring's IoC container, you may want to know more about Spring's `Resource` abstraction, which provides a convenient mechanism for reading an InputStream from locations defined in a URI syntax. In particular, `Resource` paths are used to construct applications contexts.

The following example shows the service layer objects `(services.xml)` configuration file:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
        https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

    <!-- services -->

    <bean id="petStore" class="org.springframework.samples.jpetstore.services.PetStoreServiceImpl">
        <property name="accountDao" ref="accountDao"/>
        <property name="itemDao" ref="itemDao"/>
        <!-- additional collaborators and configuration for this bean go here -->
    </bean>

    <!-- more bean definitions for services go here -->

</beans>
```

The following example shows the data access objects `daos.xml` file:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
        https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

    <bean id="accountDao"
        class="org.springframework.samples.jpetstore.dao.jpa.JpaAccountDao">
        <!-- additional collaborators and configuration for this bean go here -->
    </bean>

    <bean id="itemDao" class="org.springframework.samples.jpetstore.dao.jpa.JpaItemDao">
        <!-- additional collaborators and configuration for this bean go here -->
    </bean>

    <!-- more bean definitions for data access objects go here -->

</beans>
```

In the preceding example, the service layer consists of the `PetStoreServiceImpl` class and two data access objects of the types `JpaAccountDao` and `JpaItemDao` (based on the JPA Object-Relational Mapping standard). The `property name` element refers to the name of the JavaBean property, and the `ref` element refers to the name of another bean definition. This linkage between `id` and `ref` elements expresses the dependency between collaborating objects.

#### Composing XML-based Configuration Metadata

It can be useful to have bean definitions span multiple XML files. Often, each individual XML configuration file represents a logical layer or module in your architecture.

You can use the application context constructor to load bean definitions from all these XML fragments. This constructor takes multiple `Resource` locations, as was shown in the previous section. Alternatively, use one or more occurrences of the `<import/>` element to load bean definitions from another file or files. The following example shows how to do so:

```xml
<beans>
    <import resource="services.xml"/>
    <import resource="resources/messageSource.xml"/>
    <import resource="/resources/themeSource.xml"/>

    <bean id="bean1" class="..."/>
    <bean id="bean2" class="..."/>
</beans>
```

In the preceding example, external bean definitions are loaded from three files: `services.xml`, `messageSource.xml` and `themeSource.xml`. All location paths are relative to the definition file doing the importing, so `services.xml` must in the same directory or classpath location as the file doing the importing, while `messageSource.xml` and `themeSource.xml` must be in a `resources` location below the location of the importing file. As you can see, a leading slash is ignored. However, given that these paths are relative, it is better form not to use the slash at all. The contents of the files being imported, including the top level `<beans/>` element, must be valid XML bean definitions, according to the Spring Schema.

It is possible, but not recommended, to reference files in parent directories using a relative "../" path. Doing so creates a dependency on a file that is outside the current application. In particular, this reference is not recommended for `classpath:` URLs (for example, `classpath:../services.xml`), where the runtime resolution process chooses the "nearest" classpath root and then looks into its parent directory. Classpath configuration changes may lead to the choice of a different, incorrect directory.

You can always use fully qualified resource locations instead of relative paths: for example, `file:C:/config/services.xml` or `classpath:/config/services.xml`. However, be aware that you are coupling your application's configuration to specific absolute locations. It is generally preferable to keep an indirection for such absolute locations - for example, through "${}" placeholders that are resolved against JVM system properties at runtime.

The namespace itself provides import directive feature. Further configuration features beyond plain bean definitions are available in a selection of XML namespaces provided by Spring - for example, the `context` and `util` namespaces.

#### The Groovy Bean Definition DSL Groovy Bean

As a further example for externalized configuration metadata, bean definitions can also be expressed in Spring's Groovy Bean Definition DSL, as known from the Grails framework. Typically, such configuration live in a ".groovy" file with the structure shown in the following example:

```
beans {
    dataSource(BasicDataSource) {
        driverClassName = "org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver"
        url = "jdbc:hsqldb:mem:grailsDB"
        username = "sa"
        password = ""
        settings = [mynew:"setting"]
    }
    sessionFactory(SessionFactory) {
        dataSource = dataSource
    }
    myService(MyService) {
        nestedBean = { AnotherBean bean ->
            dataSource = dataSource
        }
    }
}
```

This configuration style is largely equivalent to XML bean definitions and even supports Spring's XML configuration namespaces. It also allows for importing XML bean definition files through an `importBeans` directive.
### 1.2.3 Using the Container

The `ApplicationContext` is the interface for an advanced factory capable of maintaining a registry of different beans and their dependencies. By using the method `T getBean(String name, Class<T> requiredType)`, you can retrieve instances of your beans.

The `ApplicationContext` lets you read bean definitions and access them, as the following example shows:

```java
ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("services.xml", "daos.xml");  // create and configure beans
PetStoreService service = context.getBean("petStore", PetStoreService.class); //retrieve configured instance
List<String> userList = service.getUsernameList();  // use configured instance
```

With Groovy configuration, bootstrapping looks very similar. It has a different context implementation class which is Groovy-aware (but also understands XML bean definitions). The following example shows Groovy configuration:

```java
ApplicationContext context = new GenericGroovyApplicationContext("services.groovy", "daos.groovy");
```

The most flexible variant is `GenericApplication` in combination with reader delegates - for example, with `XmlBeanDefinitionReader` for XML files, as the following example shows:

```java
GenericApplicationContext context = new GenericApplicationContext();
new XmlBeanDefinitionReader(context).loadBeanDefinitions("services.xml", "daos.xml");
context.refresh();
```

You can also use the `GroovyBeanDefinitionReader` for Groovy files, as the following example shows:

```java
GenericApplicationContext context = new GenericApplicationContext();
new GroovyBeanDefinitionReader(context).loadBeanDefinitions("services.groovy", "daos.groovy");
context.refresh();
```

You can mix and match such reader delegates on the same `ApplicationContext`, reading bean definitions from diverse configuration sources.

You can then use `getBean` to retrieve instances of your beans. The `ApplicationContext` interface has a few other methods for retrieving beans, but, ideally, your application code should never use them. Indeed, your application code should have no calls to the `getBean()` method at all and thus have no dependency on Spring APIs at all. For example, Spring's integration with web frameworks provides dependency injection for various web framework components such as controllers and JSF-managed beans, letting you declare a dependency on a specific bean through metadata (such as an autowring annotation).
## 1.3 Bean Overview

A Spring IoC container manages one or more beans. These beans are created with the configuration that you supply to the container (for example, in the form of XML `<bean/>` definitions).

Within the container itself, these bean definitions are represented as `BeanDefinition` objects, which contain (among other information) the following metadata:

(1) A package-qualified class name: typically, the actual implementation class of the bean being defined.

(2) Bean behavioral configuration elements, which state how the bean should behave in the container (scope, lifecycle callbacks, and so forth).

(3) References to other beans that are needed for the bean to do its work. These references are also called collaborators or dependencies.

(4) Other configuration settings to set in the newly created object - for example, the size limit of the pool or the number of connections to use in a bean that manages a connection pool.

This metadata translates to a set of properties that make up each bean definition. The following table describes these properties:

| Property | Explained in ... |
|:-:|:-:|
| Class | Instantiating Beans |
| Name | Naming Beans |
| Scope | Bean Scopes |
| Constructor arguments | Dependency Injection |
| Properties | Dependency Injection |
| Autowiring mode | Autowiring Collaborators |
| Lazy initialization mode | Lazy-initialized Beans |
| Initialization method | Initialization Callbacks |
| Destruction method | Destruction Callbacks |

In addition to bean definitions that contain information on how to create a specific bean, the `ApplicationContext` implementations also permit the registration of existing objects that are created outside the container (by users). This is done by accesing the ApplicationContext's BeanFactory through the `getBeanFactory()` method, which returns the BeanFactory `DefaultListableBeanFactory` implementation. `DefaultListableBeanFactory` supports this registration through the `registerSingleton(...)` and `registerBeanDefinition(...)` methods. However, typical application work solely with beans defined through regular bean definition metadata.

>> Bean metadata and manually supplied instances need to be registered as early as possible, in order for the container to properly reason about them during autowiring and other introspection steps. While overriding existing metadata and existing singleton instances is supported to some degree, the registration of new beans at runtime (concurrently with live access to the factory) is not officially supported and may lead to concurrent access exceptions, inconsistent state in the bean container, or both.
### 1.3.1 Naming Beans

Every bean has one or more identifiers. These identifiers must be unique within the container that hosts the bean. A bean usually has only one identifier. However, if it requires more than one, the extra ones can be considered aliases.

In XML-based configuration metadata, you use the `id` attribute, the `name` attribute, or both to specify the bean identifiers. The `id` attribute lets you specify exactly one id. Conventionally, these names are alphaumeric ('myBean', 'someService', etc.), but they can contain special characters as well. If you want to introduce other aliases for the bean, you can also specify them in the `name` attribute, separated by a comma (`,`), semicolon (`;`) or white space. As a historical note, in versions prior to Spring 3.1, the `id` attribute was defined as an `xsd:ID` type, which constrained possible characters. As of 3.1, it is defined as an `xsd:string` type. Note that bean `id` uniqueness is still enforced by the container, though no longer by XML parsers.

You are not required to supply a `name` or an `id` for a bean. If you do not supply a `name` or `id` explicitly, the container generates a unique name for that bean. However, if you want to refer to that bean by name, through the use of the `ref` element or a Service Locator style lookup, you must provide a name. Motivations for not supplying a name are related to using inner beans and autowiring collaborators.

> Bean Naming Conventions

>> The convention is to use the standard Java convention for instance field names when naming beans. That is, bean names start with a lowercase letter and are camel-cased from there. Examples of such names include `accountManager`, `accountService`, `userDao`, `loginController`, and so forth.

>> Naming beans consistently makes your configuration easier to read and understand. Also, if you use Spring AOP, it helps a lot when applying advice to a set of beans related by name.

>> With component scanning in the classpath, Spring generates bean names for unnamed components, following the rules described earlier: essentially, taking the simple class name and turning its initial character to lower-case. However, in the (unusual) special case when there is more than one character and both the first and second characters are upper case, the original casing gets preserved. There are the same rules as defined by `java.beans.Introspector.decapitalize` (which Spring uses here).
#### Aliasing a Bean outside the Bean Definition

In a bean definition itself, you can supply more than one name for the bean, by using a combination of up to one name specified by the `id` attribute and any number of other names in the `name` attribute. These names can be equivalent aliases to the same bean and are useful for some situations, such as letting each component in an application refer to a common dependency by using a bean name that is specific to that component itself.

Specifying all aliases where the bean is actually defined is not always adequate, however. It is sometimes desirable to introduce an alias for a bean that is defined elsewhere. This is commonly the case in large systems where configuration is split amongst each subsystem, with each subsystem having its own set of object definitions. In XML-based configuration metadata, you can use the `<alias/>` element to accomplish this. The following example shows how to do so:

```xml
<alias name="fromName" alias="toName"/>
```

In this case, a bean (in the same container) named `fromName` may also, after the use of this alias definition, be referred to as `toName`.

For example, the configuration metadata for subsystem A may refer to a DataSource by the name of `subsystemA-dataSource`. The configuration metadata for subsystem B may refer to a DataSource by the name of `subsystemB-dataSource`. When composing the main application that uses both these subsystems, the main application refers to the DataSource by the name of `myApp-dataSource`. To have all three names refer to the same object, you can add the following alias definitions to the configuration metadata:

```xml
<alias name="myApp-dataSource" alias="subsystemA-dataSource"/>
<alias name="myApp-dataSource" alias="subsystemB-dataSource"/>
```

Now each component and the main application can refer to the dataSource through a name that is unique and guaranteed not to clash with any other definition (effectively creating a namespace), yet they refer to the same bean.

>> If you use Java configuration, the `@Bean` annotation can be used to provide alises.
### 1.3.2 Instantiating Beans

A bean definition is essentially a recipe for creating one or more objects. The container looks at the recipe for a named bean when asked and uses the configuration metadata encapsulated by that bean definition to create (or acquire) an actual object.

If you use XML-based configuration metadata, you specify the type (or class) of object that is to be instantiated in the `class` attribute of the `<bean/>` element. This `class` attribute (which, internally, is a `Class` property on a `BeanDefinition` instance) is usually mandatory. You can use the `Class` property in one of two ways:

(1) Typically, to specify the bean class to be constructed in the case where the container itself directly creates the bean by calling its constructor reflectively, somewhat equivalent to Java code with new `new` operator.

(2) To specify the actual class containing the `static` factory method that is invoked to create the object, int the less common case where the container invokes a `static` factory method on a class to create the bean. The object type returned from the invocation of the `static` factory method may be the same class or another class entirely.

> Inner class names

>> If you want to configure a bean definition for a `static` nested class, you have to use the binary name of the nested class.

>> For example, if you have a class called `SomeThing` in the `com.example` package, and this `SomeThing` has a `static` nested class called `OtherThing`, the value of the `class` attribute on a bean definition would be `com.example.SomeThing$OtherThing`.

>> Notice the use of the `$` character in the name to separate the nested class name from the outer class name.
#### Instantiation with a Constructor

When you create a bean by the constructor approach, all normal classed are usable by and compatible with Spring. That is, the class being developed does not need to implement any specific interfaces or to be coded in a specific fashion. Simply specifying the bean class should suffice. However, depending on what type of IoC you use for that specific bean, you may need a default (empty) constructor.

The Spring IoC container can manage virtually any class you want it to manage. It is not limited to managing true JavaBeans. Most Spring users prefer actual JavaBeans with only a default (no-argument) constructor and appropriate setters and getters modeled after the properties in the container. You can also have more exotic non-bean-style classes in your container. If, for example, you need to use a legacy connection pool that absolutely does not adhere to the JavaBean specification, Spring can manage it as well.

With XML-based configuration metadata you can specify your bean class as follows:

```xml
<bean id="exampleBean" class="examples.ExampleBean"/>

<bean name="anotherExample" class="examples.ExampleBeanTwo"/>
```
#### Instantiation with a Static Factory Method

When defining a bean that you create with a static factory method, use the `class` attribute to specify the class that contains the `static` factory method and an attribute named `factory-method` to specify the name of the factory method itself. You should be able to call this method (with optional arguments, as described later) and return a live object, which subsquently is treated as if it had been created through a constructor. One use for such a bean definition is to call `static` factories in legacy code.

The following bean definition specifies that the bean be created by calling a factory method. The definition does not specify the type (class) of the returned object, only the class containing the factory method. In this example, the `createInstance()` method must be a static method. The following example shows how to specify a factory method:

```xml
<bean id="clientService" class="examples.ClientService" factory-method="createInstance"/>
```

The following example shows a class that would work with the preceding bean definition:

```java
public class ClientService {
    private static ClientService clientService = new ClientService();
    private ClientService() {}

    public static ClientService createInstance() {
        return clientService;
    }
}
```
#### Instantiation by Using an Instance Factory Method

Similar to instantiation through a static factory method, instantiation with an instance factory method invokes a non-static method of an existing bean from the container to create a new bean. To use this mechanism, leave the `class` attribute empty and, in the `factory-bean` attribute, specify the name of a bean in the current (or parent or ancestor) container that contains the instance method that is to be invoked to create the object. Set the name of the factory method itself with the `factory-method` attribute. The following example shows how to configure such a bean:

```xml
<bean id="serviceLocator" class="examples.DefaultServiceLocator"/>
<bean id="clientService" factory-bean="serviceLocator" factory-method="createClientServiceInstance"/>
```

The following example shows the corresponding class:

```java
public class DefaultServiceLocator {

    private static ClientService clientService = new ClientServiceImpl();

    public ClientService createClientServiceInstance() {
        return clientService;
    }
}
```

One factory class can also hold more than one factory method, as the following example shows:

```xml
<bean id="serviceLocator" class="examples.DefaultServiceLocator"/>

<bean id="clientService" factory-bean="serviceLocator" factory-method="createClientServiceInstance"/>

<bean id="accountService" factory-bean="serviceLocator" factory-method="createAccountServiceInstance"/>
```

The following example shows the corresponding class:

```java
public class DefaultServiceLocator {

    private static ClientService clientService = new ClientServiceImpl();

    private static AccountService accountService = new AccountServiceImpl();

    public ClientService createClientServiceInstance() {
        return clientService;
    }

    public AccountService createAccountServiceInstance() {
        return accountService;
    }
}
```

>> In Spring documentation, "factory bean" refers to a bean that is configured in the Spring container and that creates obejcts through an factory method. By contrast, `FactoryBean` refers to a Spring-specific `FactoryBean`.
## 1.4 Dependencies

A typical enterprise application does not consist of a single object (or bean in the Spring parlance). Even the simplest application has a few objects that work together to present what the end-user sees as a coherent application. This next section explains how you go from defining a number of bean definitions that stand alone to a fully realized application where objects collaborate to achieve a goal.
### 1.4.1 Dependency Injection

Dependency injection (DI) is a process whereby objects define their dependencies (that is, the other objects with which they work) only through constructor arguments, arguments to a factory method, or properties that are set on the object instance after it is constructed or returned from a factory method. The container then injects those dependencies when it creates the bean. This process is fundamentally the inverse (hence the name, Inversion of Control) of the bean itself controlling the instantiation or location of its dependencies on its own by using direct construction of classes or the Service Locator pattern.

Code is cleaner with the DI principle, and decouping is more effective when objects are provided with their dependencies. The object does not look up its dependencies and does not know the location or class of the dependencies. As a result, your class become easier to test, particular when the dependencies are on interfaces or abstract base classes, which allow for stub or mock implementations to be used in unit tests.

DI exists in two major variants: `Constructor-based dependency injection` and `Setter-based dependency injection`.
#### Constructor-based Dependency Injection

Constructor-based DI is accomplished by the container invoking a constructor with a number of arguments, each representing a dependency. Calling a `static` factory method with specific arguments to construct the bean is nearly equivalent, and this discussion treats arguments to a constructor and to a `static` factory method similarly. The following example shows a class that only be dependency-injected with constructor injection:

```java
public class SimpleMovieLister {

    // the SimpleMovieLister has a dependency on a MovieFinder
    private MovieFinder movieFinder;

    // a constructor so that the Spring container can inject a MovieFinder
    public SimpleMovieLister(MovieFinder movieFinder) {
        this.movieFinder = movieFinder;
    }

    // business logic that actually uses the injected MovieFinder is omitted...
}
```

Notice that there is nothing special about this class. It is a POJO that has no dependencies on container specific interfaces, base classes or annotations.
##### Constructor Argument Resolution

Constructor argument resolution matching occurs by using the argument's type. If no potential ambiguity exists in the consturctor arguments of a bean definition, the order in which the constructor arguments are defined in a bean definition is the order in which those arguments are supplied to the appropriate constructor when the bean is being instantiated. Consider the following class:

```java
public class ThingOne {

    public ThingOne(ThingTwo thingTwo, ThingThree thingThree) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

Assuming that `ThingTwo` and `ThingThree` classes are not related by inheritance, no potential ambiguity exists. Thus, the following configuration works fine, and you do not need to specify the constructor argument indexes or types explicitly in the `<constructor-arg/>` element.

```xml
<beans>
    <bean id="beanOne" class="x.y.ThingOne">
        <constructor-arg ref="beanTwo"/>
        <constructor-arg ref="beanThree"/>
    </bean>

    <bean id="beanTwo" class="x.y.ThingTwo"/>

    <bean id="beanThree" class="x.y.ThingThree"/>
</beans>
```

When another bean is referenced, the type is known, and matching can occur (as was the case with the preceding example). When a simple type is used, such as `<value>true<value/>`, Spring cannot determine the type of the value, and so cannot match by type without help. Consider the following class:

```java
public class ExampleBean {

    // Number of years to calculate the Ultimate Answer
    private int years;

    // The Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything
    private String ultimateAnswer;

    public ExampleBean(int years, String ultimateAnswer) {
        this.years = years;
        this.ultimateAnswer = ultimateAnswer;
    }
}
```
###### Constructor argument type matching

In the preceding scenario, the container can use type matching with simple types if you explicitly specify the type of the constructor argument by using the `type` attribute. As the following example shows:

```xml
<bean id="exampleBean" class="examples.ExampleBean">
    <constructor-arg type="int" value="7500000"/>
    <constructor-arg type="java.lang.String" value="42"/>
</bean>
```
###### Constructor argument index

You can use the `index` attribute to specify explicitly the index of constructor arguments, as the following example shows:

```xml
<bean id="exampleBean" class="examples.ExampleBean">
    <constructor-arg index="0" value="7500000"/>
    <constructor-arg index="1" value="42"/>
</bean>
```

In addition to resolving the ambiguity of multiple simple values, specifying an index resolves ambiguity where a consructor has two arguments of the same type.

>> The index is 0-based.
###### Constructor argument name

You can also use the constructor parameter name for value disambiguation, as the following example shows:

```xml
<bean id="exampleBean" class="examples.ExampleBean">
    <constructor-arg name="years" value="7500000"/>
    <constructor-arg name="ultimateAnswer" value="42"/>
</bean>
```

Keep in mind that, to make this work out of the box, your code must be compiled with the debug flag enabled so that Spring can look up the parameter name from the constructor. If you cannot or do not want to compile your code with the debug flag, you can use the `@ConstructorProperties` JDK annotation to explicitly name your constructor arguments. The sample class would then have to look as follows:

```java
public class ExampleBean {
    @ConstructorProperties({"years", "ultimateAnswer"})
    public ExampleBean(int years, String ultimateAnswer) {
        this.years = years;
        this.ultimateAnswer = ultimateAnswer;
    }
}
```
#### Setter-based Dependency Injection

Setter-based DI is accomplished by the container calling setter methods on your beans after invoking a no-argument constructor or a no-argument static factory method to instantiate your bean.

The following example shows a class that can only be dependency-injected by using pure setter injection. This class is conventional Java. It is a POJO that has no dependencies on container specific interfaces, base classes, or annotations.

```java
public class SimpleMovieLister {
    private MovieFinder movieFinder;

    public void setMovieFinder(MovieFinder movieFinder) {
        this.movieFinder = movieFinder;
    }
}
```

The `ApplicationContext` supports constructor-based and setter-based DI for the beans it manages. It also supports setter-based DI after some dependencies have already been injected through the constructor approach. You configure the dependencies in the form of a `BeanDefinition`, which you use in conjunction with `PropertyEditor` instances to convert properties from one format to another. However, most Spring users do not work with these classes directly (that is, programmatically) but rather with XML bean definitions, annotated components (that is, classes annotated with `@Component`, `@Controller`, and so forth), or `@Bean` methods in Java-based `@Configuration` classes. These sources are then converted internally into instances of `BeanDefinition` and used to load an entire Spring IoC container instance.

> Constructor-based or setter-based DI?

>> Since you can mix constructor-based and setter-based DI, it is a good rule of thumb to use constructors for mandatory dependencies and setter methods or configuration methods for optional dependencies. Not that use of the `@Required` annotation on a setter method can be used to make the property be a required dependency; however, constructor injection with programmatic validation of arguments is preferable.

>> The Spring team generally advocates construtor injection, as it lets you implement application components as immutable objects and ensures that required dependencies are not null. Furthermore, constructor-injected components are always returned to the client (calling) code in a fully initialized state. As a side node, a large number of constructor arguments is a bad code smell, implying that the class likely has too many responsibilities and should be better address proper separation of concerns.

>> Setter injection should primarily only be used for optional dependencies that can be assigned reasonable default values within the class. Otherwise, not-null checks must be performed everywhere the code uses the dependency. One benefit of setter injection is that setter methods make objects of that class amenable to reconfiguration or re-injection later. Management through JMX MBeans is therefore a compelling use case for setter injection.

>> Use the DI style that makes the most sense for a particular class. Sometimes, when dealing with third-party classes for which you do not have the source, the choice is made for you. For example, if a third-party class does not expose any setter methods, then constructor injection may be the only available form of DI.
#### Dependency Resolution Process

The container performs bean dependency resolution as follows:

(1) The `ApplicationContext` is created and initialized with configuration metadata that describes all the beans. Configuration metadata can be specified by XML, Java code, or annotations.

(2) For each bean, its dependencies are expressed in the form of properties, constructor arguments, or arguments to the static-factory method (if you use that instead of a normal constructor). These dependencies are provided to the bean, when the bean is actually created.

(3) Each property or constructor argument is an actual definition of the value to set, or a reference to another bean in the container.

(4) Each property or constructor argument that is value is converted from its specified format to the actual type of that property or constructor argument. By default, Spring can convert a value supplied in string format to all built-in types, such as `int`, `long`, `String`, `boolean`, and so forth.

The Spring container validates the configuration of each bean as the container is created. However, the bean properties themselves are not set until the bean is actually created. Beans that are singleton-scoped and set to be pre-instantiated (the default) are created when the container is created. Scopes are defined in Bean Scopes. Otherwise, the bean is created only when it is requested. Creation of a bean potentially causes a graph of beans to be created, as the bean's dependencies and its denpendencies' dependencies (and so on) are created and assigned. Not that resolution mismatches among those dependencies may show up late - that is, on first creation of the affected bean.

> Circular dependencies

>> If you use predominantly constructor injection, it is possible to create an unresolvable circular dependency scenario.

>> For example: Class A requires an instance of class B through constructor injection, and class B requires an instance of class A through constructor injection. If you configure beans for classes A and B to be injected into each other, the Spring IoC container detects this circular reference at runtime, and throws a `BeanCurrentlyInCreationException`.

>> One possible solution is to edit the source code of some classes to be configured by setters rather than constructors. Alternatively, avoid constructor injection and use setter injection only. In other words, although it is not recommended, you can configure circular dependencies with setter injection.

>> Unlike the typical case (with no circular dependencies), a circular dependency between bean A and bean B forces one of the beans to be injected into the other prior to being fully initialized itself (a classic chicken-and-egg scenario).

You can generally trust Spring to do the right thing. It detects configuration problems, such as references to non-existent beans and circular dependencies, at container load-time. Spring sets properties and resolves dependencies as late as possible, when the bean is actually created. This means that a Spring container that has loaded correctly can later generate an exception when you request an object if there is a problem creating that object or one of its dependencies - for example, the bean throws an exception as a result of a missing or invalid property. This potentially delayed visibility of some configuration issues is why `ApplicationContext` implementations by default pre-instantiate singleton beans. At the cost of some upfront time and memory to create these beans before they are actually needed, you discover configuration issues when the `ApplicationContext` is created, not later. You can still override this default behavior so that singleton beans initialize lazily, rather than being pre-instantiated.

If no circular dependencies exist, when one or more collaborating beans are being injected into a dependent bean, each collaborating bean is totally configured prior to being injected into the dependent bean. This means that, if bean A has a dependency on bean B, the Spring IoC container completely configures bean B prior to invoking the setter method on bean A. In other words, the bean is instantiated (if it is not a pre-instantiated singleton), its dependencies are set, and the relevant lifecycle methods (such as a configred init method or the InitializingBean callback method) are invoked.
#### Examples Dependency Injection

The following example uses XML-based configuration metadata for setter-based DI. A small part of a Spring XML configuration file specifies some bean definitions as follows:

```xml
<bean id="exampleBean" class="examples.ExampleBean">
    <!-- setter injection using the nested ref element -->
    <property name="beanOne">
        <ref bean="anotherExampleBean"/>
    </property>

    <!-- setter injection using the neater ref attribute -->
    <property name="beanTwo" ref="yetAnotherBean"/>
    <property name="integerProperty" value="1"/>
</bean>

<bean id="anotherExampleBean" class="examples.AnotherBean"/>
<bean id="yetAnotherBean" class="examples.YetAnotherBean"/>
```

The following example shows the corresponding `ExampleBean` classes:

```java
public class ExampleBean {
    private AnotherBean beanOne;

    private YetAnotherBean beanTwo;

    private int i;

    public void setBeanOne(AnotherBean beanOne) {
        this.beanOne = beanOne;
    }

    public void setBeanTwo(YetAnotherBean beanTwo) {
        this.beanTwo = beanTwo;
    }

    public void setIntegerProperty(int i) {
        this.i = i;
    }
}
```

In the preceding example, setters are declared to match against the properties specified in the XML file. The following example uses constructor-based DI:

```xml
<bean id="exampleBean" class="examples.ExampleBean">
    <!-- constructor injection using the nested ref element -->
    <constructor-arg>
        <ref bean="anotherExampleBean"/>
    </constructor-arg>

    <!-- constructor injection using the neater ref attribute -->
    <constructor-arg ref="yetAnotherBean"/>

    <constructor-arg type="int" value="1"/>
</bean>

<bean id="anotherExampleBean" class="examples.AnotherBean"/>
<bean id="yetAnotherBean" class="examples.YetAnotherBean"/>
```

The following example shows the corresponding `ExampleBean` class:

```java
public class ExampleBean {
    private AnotherBean beanOne;

    private YetAnotherBean beanTwo;

    private int i;

    public ExampleBean(
        AnotherBean anotherBean, YetAnotherBean yetAnotherBean, int i) {
        this.beanOne = anotherBean;
        this.beanTwo = yetAnotherBean;
        this.i = i;
    }
}
```

The constructor arguments specified in the bean definition are used as arguments to the constructor of the `ExampleBean`.

Now consider a variant of this example, where, instead of using a constructor, Spring is told to call a static factory method to return an instance of the object:

```xml
<bean id="exampleBean" class="examples.ExampleBean" factory-method="createInstance">
    <constructor-arg ref="anotherExampleBean"/>
    <constructor-arg ref="yetAnotherBean"/>
    <constructor-arg value="1"/>
</bean>

<bean id="anotherExampleBean" class="examples.AnotherBean"/>
<bean id="yetAnotherBean" class="examples.YetAnotherBean"/>
```

The following example shows the corresponding `ExampleBean` class:

```java
public class ExampleBean {

    // a private constructor
    private ExampleBean(...) {
        ...
    }

    // a static factory method; the arguments to this method can be
    // considered the dependencies of the bean that is returned,
    // regardless of how those arguments are actually used.
    public static ExampleBean createInstance (
        AnotherBean anotherBean, YetAnotherBean yetAnotherBean, int i) {

        ExampleBean eb = new ExampleBean (...);
        // some other operations...
        return eb;
    }
}
```

Arguments to the static factory method are supplied by `<constructor-arg/>` elements, exactly the same as if a constructor had actually been used. The type of the class being returned by the factory method does not have to be of the same type as the class that contains the static factory method (although, in this example, it is). An instance (non-static) factory method can be used in an essentially identical fashion (aside from the use of the `factory-bean` attribute instead of the `class` attribute).
### 1.4.2 Dependencies and Configuration in Detail

As mentioned in the previous section, you can define bean properties and constructor arguments as references to other managed beans (collaborators) or as values defined inline. Spring's XML-based configuration metadata supports sub-element types within its `<property/>` and `<constructor-arg/>` elements for this purpose.
#### Straight Values (Primitives, Strings, and so on)

The `value` attribute of the `<property/>` element specifies a property or constructor argument as a human-readable string representation. Spring's conversion service is used to convert these values from a `String` to the actual type of the property or argument. The following example shows various values being set:

```xml
<bean id="myDataSource" class="org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource" destroy-method="close">
    <!-- results in a setDriverClassName(String) call -->
    <property name="driverClassName" value="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"/>
    <property name="url" value="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb"/>
    <property name="username" value="root"/>
    <property name="password" value="masterkaoli"/>
</bean>
```

The following example uses the p-namespace for even more succinct XML configuration:

```xml
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xmlns:p="http://www.springframework.org/schema/p"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
    https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

    <bean id="myDataSource" class="org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource"
        destroy-method="close"
        p:driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
        p:url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb"
        p:username="root"
        p:password="masterkaoli"/>

</beans>
```

The preceding XML is more succinct. However, typos are discovered at runtime rather than design time, unless you use an IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA or the Spring Tools for Eclipse) that supports automatic property completion when you create bean definitions. Such IDE assistance is highly recommended.

You can also configure a `java.util.Properties` instance, as follows:

```xml
<bean id="mappings"
    class="org.springframework.context.support.PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer">

    <!-- typed as a java.util.Properties -->
    <property name="properties">
        <value>
            jdbc.driver.className=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
            jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
        </value>
    </property>
</bean>
```

The Spring container converts the text inside the `<value/>` element into a `java.util.Properties` instance by using the JavaBeans `PropertyEditor` mechanism. This is a nice shortcut, and is one of a few places where the Spring team do favor the use of the nested `<value/>` element over the `value` attribute style.
##### The `idref` element

The `idref` element is simply an error-proof way to pass the `id` (a string value - not a reference) of another bean in the container to a `<constructor-arg/>` or `<property/>` element. The following example shows how to use it:

```xml
<bean id="theTargetBean" class="..."/>

<bean id="theClientBean" class="...">
    <property name="targetName">
        <idref bean="theTargetBean"/>
    </property>
</bean>
```

The preceding bean definition snippet is exactly equivalent (at runtime) to the following snippet:

```xml
<bean id="theTargetBean" class="..." />

<bean id="client" class="...">
    <property name="targetName" value="theTargetBean"/>
</bean>
```

The first form is preferable to the second, because using the `idref` tag lets the container validate at deployment time that the referenced, named bean actually exists. In the second variation, no validation is performed on the value that is passed to the `targetName` property of the `client` bean. Typos are only discovered (with most likely fatal results) when the `client` bean is actually instantiated. If the `client` bean is a prototype bean, this typo and the resulting exception may only be discovered long after the container is deployed.

A common place (at least in versions earlier than Spring 2.0) where the `<idref/>` element brings value is in the configuration of AOP interceptors in a `ProxyFactoryBean` bean definition. Using `<idref/>` elements when you specify the interceptor names prevents you from misspelling an interceptor ID.
#### References to Other Beans (Collaborators)

The `ref` element is the final element inside a `<constructor-arg/>` or `<property/>` definition element. Here, you set the value of the specified property of a bean to be a reference to another bean (a collaborator) managed by the container. The referenced bean is a dependency of the bean whose property is to be set, and it is initialized on demand as needed before the property is set. (If the collaborator is a singleton bean, it may already be initialized by the container.) All references are ultimately a reference to another object. Scoping and validation depend on whether you specify the ID or name of the other object through the `bean` of `parent` attribute.

Specifying the target bean through the `bean` attribute of the `<ref/>` tag is the most general form and allows creation of a reference to any bean in the same container or parent container, regardless of whether it is in the same XML file. The value of the `bean` attribute may be the same as the `id` attribute of the target bean or be the same as one of the values in the `name` attribute of the target bean. The following example shows how to use a `ref` element:

```xml
<ref bean="someBean"/>
```

Specifying the target bean through the `parent` attribute creates a reference to a bean that is in a parent container of the current container. The value of the `parent` attribute may be the same as either the `id` attribute of the target bean or one of the values in the `name` attribute of the target bean. The target bean must be in a parent container of the current one. You should use this bean reference variant mainly when you have a hierarchy of containers and you want to wrap an existing bean in a parent container with a proxy that has the same name as the parent bean. The following pair of listings shows how to use the `parent` attribute:

```xml
<!-- in the parent context -->
<bean id="accountService" class="com.something.SimpleAccountService">
    <!-- insert dependencies as required as here -->
</bean>
```

```xml
<!-- in the child (descendant) context -->
<bean id="accountService" <!-- bean name is the same as the parent bean -->
    class="org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactoryBean">
    <property name="target">
        <ref parent="accountService"/> <!-- notice how we refer to the parent bean -->
    </property>
    <!-- insert other configuration and dependencies as required here -->
</bean>
```
#### Inner Beans

A `<bean/>` element inside the `<property/>` or `<constructor-arg/>` elements defines an inner bean, as the following example shows:

```xml
<bean id="outer" class="...">
    <!-- instead of using a reference to a target bean, simply define the target bean inline -->
    <property name="target">
        <bean class="com.example.Person"> <!-- this is the inner bean -->
            <property name="name" value="Fiona Apple"/>
            <property name="age" value="25"/>
        </bean>
    </property>
</bean>
```

An inner bean definition does not require a defined ID or name. If specified, the container does not use such a value as an indentifier. The container also ignores the `scope` flag on creation, because inner beans are always anonymous and are always created with the outer bean. It is not possible to access inner beans independently or to inject them into collaborating beans other than into the enclosing bean.

As a corner case, it is possible to receive destruction callbacks from a custom scope - for example, for a request-scoped inner bean contained within a singleton bean. The creation of the inner bean instance is tied to its containing bean, but destruction callbacks let it participate in the request scope's lifecycle. This is not a common scenario. Inner beans typically simply share their containing bean's scope.
